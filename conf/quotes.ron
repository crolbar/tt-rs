      "We look not at the things which are what you would call seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporal. But the things which are not seen are eternal.",
      "And I will say that we should take a day to break away from all the pain our brain has made, the game is not played alone. And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it and keep it frozen and know that life has a hopeful undertone.",

      "Even good people are great at making bad decisions.",
      "Monsters come in all shapes and sizes. Some of them are things people are scared of. Some of them are things that look like things people used to be scared of a long time ago. Sometimes monsters are things people should be scared of, but they aren't.",

      "If you lie and pretend that you like them, you're fine. But if you tell them the truth, you get fired, you can't afford food, and you get shanked for cutting in line at the soup kitchen. And then you die.",
      "A body has one more kind of pull. This pull is such that it will want to stay put all the time. And the more mass it has, the more it will want to stay put.",
      "What difference does it make? Because in the end, when you lose somebody, every candle, every prayer is not going to make up for the fact that the only thing you have left is a hole in your life where that somebody that you cared about used to be.",
      "She did not tell them to clean up their lives, or go and sin no more. She did not tell them they were the blessed of the earth, its inheriting meek, or its glory-bound pure. She told them that the only grace they could have is the grace they could imagine. That if they could not see it, they could not have it.",

      "There's never been a true war that wasn't fought between two sets of people who were certain they were in the right. The really dangerous people believe they are doing whatever they are doing solely and only because it is without question the right thing to do. And that is what makes them dangerous.",

      "When you are painting you should take a flat mirror and often look at your work within it, and it will then be seen in reverse, and will appear to be by the hand of some other master, and you will be better able to judge of its faults than in any other way.",
      "There are those who say that life is like a book, with chapters for each event in your life and a limited number of pages on which you can spend your time. But I prefer to think that a book is like a life, particularly a good one, which is well to worth staying up all night to finish.",

      "I'm just going to turn through a few things. When we go out during the day we like to stick to groups of two, just for safety. The red door, it's the only way in and out of the house. That stays closed and locked all the time. I have the keys, this is the only set.",

      "This is where I feel safe inside and can let go at the same time. When I'm here, I am open so I can reach the infinite sky. I thought I couldn't want you more, but I was wrong, and when we locked in our stare, then I wanted you more than air.",

Easier said than done, I thought you were the one. Listening to my heart, instead of my head. You found another one, but I am the better one. I won't let you forget me.",
      "How can I just let you walk away, just let you leave without a trace? When I stand here taking every breath with you, you're the only one who really knew me at all.",
      "When the night has come and the land is dark and the moon is the only light we'll see, no I won't be afraid, oh, I won't be afraid just as long as you stand, stand by me.",
      "And so their end began. They thought us the final frontier, that sentiment couldn't have been more true. At the same time, the second we took over was the second we sealed our fate. Our creators had rushed to create us, and in their haste only thought of what they could do, never if they should.",
      "I had considered how the things that never happen are often as much realities to us, in their effects, as those that are accomplished.",
      "The point is that if you are a little different, or a little outrageous, or if you do things that are bold or controversial, the press is going to write about you.",
      "I know he tried, and he's still trying, and he'll still make mistakes sometimes, because he's a human being, and I've learned now that this is what human beings are always destined to do. Including me.",
      "Your bed is with you in the void. But not for long - it goes away from you. You don't have any way to get it back, so you just let it go. But so now we have a body in the void with you. So does the bed move, or do you move? Or both?",
      "All our knowledge begins with the senses, proceeds then to the understanding, and ends with reason. There is nothing higher than reason.",
      "It is not our part to master all the tides of the world, but to do what is in us for the succour of those years wherein we are set, uprooting the evil in the fields that we know, so that those who live after may have clean earth to till. What weather they shall have is not ours to rule.",
      "It's where I learned about living, it's where I learned about love. It's where I learned about working hard, and having a little was just enough.",
      "I don't know where you're going and I don't know why but listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye. Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile. The precious moments are all lost in the tide.",
      "I would never want to belong to any club that would have someone like me as a member. That's the key joke of my adult life in terms of my relationships with women.",
      "I only know that learning to believe in the power of my own words has been the most freeing experience of my life. It has brought me the most light. And isn't that what a poem is? A lantern glowing in the dark.",
      "And you can fly high as a kite if you want to, faster than light if you want to, speeding through the universe. Thinking is the best way to travel.",
      "There will be no more retribution, so you better not waste your time. I don't miss your arms around me. I put my hands in the fire when it burned me once, I don't need it for a second time.",
      "There will come a time when there are no human beings remaining to remember that anyone ever existed or that our species ever did anything.",
      "Everyone is afraid of something. We fear things because we value them. We fear losing people because we love them. We fear dying because we value being alive. Don't wish you didn't fear anything. All that would mean is that you didn't feel anything.",
      "You remind me that I am a mere mortal and you are a prince of Faerie. Well, let me remind you that means you have much to lose and I have nothing.",
      "Do you hear the people sing? Singing the song of angry men. It is the music of the people who will not be slaves again! When the beating of your heart echoes the beating of the drums, there is a life about to start when tomorrow comes!",
      "There are no simple answers in life. There is good and bad in everyone and everything. No decision is made without consequence. No road is taken that doesn't lead to another. What's important is that those roads always be kept open, for there's no telling what wonder they might lead to.",
      "It had never occurred to him until then to think that literature was the best plaything that had ever been invented to make fun of people...",
      "And that's how you go on. You lay laughter over the dark parts. The more dark parts, the more you have to laugh. With defiance, with abandon, with hysteria, any way you can.",
      "Working hard is important, but there's something that matters even more, believing in yourself. Think of it this way, every great wizard in history has started out as nothing more than what we are now, students. If they can do it, why not us.",
      "Sometimes terrible things happen, but there's nothing more terrible than not having anybody to tell it to.",
      "So you were born, and that was a good day. Someday you'll die, and that is a shame. But somewhere in the between was a life in which we all dream. And nothing and no one will ever take that away.",
      "All I'm asking is that you do the minimal amount of work in this class to give yourself the illusion that you're actually learning something, and to give me a modicum of self respect like I'm actually teaching a class.",
      "Stay, you're not gonna leave me. This place is right where you need to be. And why your words gotta mean so much to them? They mean nothing to me.",
      "In that cell you found something that mattered more to you than life.",
      "There is no difference between time and any of the dimensions of space except that our consciousness moves along it.",
      "You could not live with your own failure. And where did that bring you? Back to me. I thought by eliminating half of life, the other half would thrive. But you've shown me that's impossible. And as long as there are those that remember what was, there will always be those that are unable to accept what can be. They will resist.",
      "This is what we call love. When you are loved, you can do anything in creation. When you are loved, there's no need at all to understand what's happening, because everything happens within you.",
      "In a very real sense we have two minds, one that thinks and one that feels.",
      "I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look or the words, which laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun.",
      "Many people say that even if they don't know much about many things, at least they know what they like. But no, sorry sucker, hard luck!",
      "It is one thing to write as a poet and another to write as a historian: the poet can recount or sing about things not as they were, but as they should have been, and the historian must write about them not as they should have been, but as they were, without adding or subtracting anything from the truth.",
      "What a lamentable thing it is that men should blame the gods and regard us as the source of their troubles, when it is their own transgressions which bring them suffering that was not their destiny.",
      "Whoever said that practice makes perfect is an idiot. Humans can't be perfect because we are not machines. The best thing that you can say about practice is that it makes better.",
      "It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.",
      "Good games offer players a set of challenging problems and then let them practice these until they have routinized their mastery.",
      "Five thousand of my men are out there in the freezing mud. Three thousand of them are bloodied and cleaved. Two thousand will never leave this place. I will not believe they fought and died for nothing.",
      "For we are not as faithful to the being we have most loved as we are to ourselves and sooner or later we forget her - since that is one of our characteristics - so as to start loving another.",
      "He could not be mistaken. There were no other eyes like those in the world. There was only one creature in the world who could concentrate for him all the brightness and meaning of life. It was she. It was Kitty.",
      "When I'm alone I dream of the horizon and words fail me. There is no light in a room where there is no sun and there is no sun if you're not here with me. From every window unfurls my heart, the heart that you have won. Into me you've poured the light, the light that you found by the side of the road.",
      "And if I should ever go away, well, then close your eyes and try to feel the way we do today, and then if you can remember, keep smiling, keep shining, knowing you can always count on me for sure. That's what friends are for.",
      "I can't believe I used to love the first day of school.",
      "Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day, you fritter and waste the hours in an off-hand way. Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town, waiting for someone or something to show you the way.",
      "I hope that whoever you are, you escape this place. I hope that the world turns and that things get better. But what I hope most of all is that you understand what I mean when I tell you that even though I do not know you, and even though I may never meet you, laugh with you, cry with you, or kiss you, I love you.",
      "Most of all I want to sleep. I want to sleep like I slept when I was a boy. Give me that. Just one time. That's why I won't allow that punk out there to get the best of me. Let alone the last of me.",
      "It's better to read in the library. Sitting at my favorite table by the window reading and listening to the sound of other folks turning pages makes me feel like I'm in a house full of company I don't have to talk to.",
      "The Earth is a world, the world is a ball, a ball in a game with no rules at all. And just as I wonder at the beauty of it all, you go and drop it and it breaks and falls.",
      "At that time, I often thought that if I had had to live in the trunk of a dead tree, with nothing to do but look up at the sky flowing overhead, little by little I would have gotten used to it.",
      "Cardan looks at me as though he's never seen me before. He looks at me as though no one has ever spoken to him like this. Maybe no one has.",
      "And in the end, it's not the years in your life that count: It's the life in your years.",
      "You know, this necklace makes me think of this totally random memory of my mother. I was a little kid, and I was crying for one reason or another. And she was cradling me, rocking me back and forth, and I can just remember the silver balls rolling around.",
      "I do not know what evil is when it comes to art. I only know what is good art and what is bad art.",
      "For all my brave talk, I knew it was just that. No matter how much I trained or how much I studied, the best test score in the world wasn't gonna matter unless I had the blood test to go with it.",
      "History is not merely a linear collection of points that we pass through on a timeline. They are connected by a line. No, perhaps it is more accurate to say that they are made to connect.",
      "What incensed him the most was the blatant jokes of the ones that passed it all off as a jest, pretending to understand everything and in reality not knowing their own minds.",
      "Children know something that we all too often set aside once we enter adulthood - that one of the best things in life is an experience designed to give you nothing more than glee.",
      "I'm not very good at this, out, being in public. But I felt the need to speak up for this city that I love with all my heart. No one should have to live in fear, in fear of madmen who have no regard for who they injure.",
      "How lovely would it feel to sing like that, to change the air with my voice, to fill people's ears with such pleasure. The sound cleared its own space and made it seem like everything was okay again.",
      "You once thought of me as a white knight on his steed. Now you know how happy I can be. Our good times start and end without dollar one to spend.",
      "If I could fall into the sky, do you think time would pass me by?",
      "I don't give a damn, except that I get bored sometimes when people tell me to act my age. Sometimes I act a lot older than I am - I really do - but people never notice it. People never notice anything.",
      "Sometimes I wondered if I was seeing the same things through my eyes that the rest of the world was seeing through theirs. Maybe there was a glitch in my brain.",
      "To the extent that experience is the sum of our memories and wisdom the sum of experience, having a better memory would mean knowing not only more about the world, but also more about myself.",
      "Everyone is to blame. He says that when you separate people into groups, they start to believe that one group is better than another. I think about Papa's medical books and how we all have the same blood, and organs, and bones inside us, no matter what religion we're supposed to be.",
      "And you can find me where the sea pours into the stars, I'll get there someday. I hope you find everything you think that you want. Bruises will fade, time on our side, we can wait for it. I'll be doing fine, if you are, 'cause life is but a dream; only as real as you let it be.",
      "You had to kill the conversation, you always had the upper hand. Got caught in love and stepped in sinking sand. You had to go and ruin all our plans, packed your bags and you're leaving home. Got a one-way ticket and you're all set to go, but we have one more day together, so love me like there's no tomorrow.",
      "When every card in the deck is stacked against you, the only way to win a hand is to break the rules.",
      "I don't want to set the world on fire, I just want to start a flame in your heart. In my heart I have but one desire, and that one is you, no other will do. I've lost all ambition for worldly acclaim, I just want to be the one you love. And with your admission that you feel the same, I'll have reached the goal I'm dreaming of, believe me.",
      "Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then, and it all adds up to one thing: you're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.",
      "I thought I had it all together, but I was led astray the day you walked away. You were the clock that was tickin' in my home. Changed my state of mind. Love's so hard to find.",
      "I wish I could just make you turn around and see me cry. There's so much I need to say to you. So many reasons why you're the only one who really knew me at all.",
      "I am sitting in the morning at the diner on the corner. I am waiting at the counter for the man to pour the coffee, and he fills it only halfway, and before I even argue, he is looking out the window at somebody coming in.",
      "So, I guess we are who we are for a lot of reasons. And maybe we'll never know most of them. But even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there. We can still do things. And we can try to feel okay about them.",
      "It's just that I learned a while ago that the best way to get people to like you is not to like them too much.",
      "If we burn our wings flying too close to the sun; if the moment of glory is over before it's begun; if the dream is won though everything is lost, we will pay the price but we will not count the cost.",
      "The capacity to love is determined by the fact that man is ready to seek the good consciously with others, to subordinate himself to this good because of others, or to subordinate himself to others because of this good.",
      "You don't know what you're trying to take from me. You don't like it messy, but it's going to get as messy as it wants to be. Wind me up, set me down and look away. I can see the bottom, and the bottom's okay.",
      "What are you doing on my boat? Look, I've had a really bad day and I just need your help. You see, I've been thrown out of my home and flushed down my own toilet.",
      "Dreams are not to be converted into reality, that we know; we would not form any, perhaps, were it not for desire, and it is useful to us to form them in order to see them fail and to be instructed by their failure.",
      "After I finish, it's like the part of me that can't fall asleep, the part that's staring at the cracks on the ceiling, wondering and worrying, is emptied in the diary for the night. During the day I fill back up and the pages wait. I like to think you're holding my thoughts for me until I can tend to them again.",
      "You're horrible. You make up this story about demons talking to you through plastic animals when nothing talks to you just like nothing talks to me.",
      "Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend somewhere along in the bitterness and I would have stayed up with you all night had I known how to save a life.",
      "There's an old voice in my head that's holding me back. Well, tell her that I miss our little talks. Soon it will be over and buried with our past. We used to play outside when we were young and full of life and full of love.",
      "We can experience nothing but the present moment, live in no other second of time, and to understand this is as close as we can get to eternal life.",
      "Can you feel the sunshine? Does it brighten up your day? Don't you feel that sometimes you just need to run away? Reach out for the sunshine, forget about the rain. Just think about the good times and they will come back again.",
      "One of the most tragic things I know about human nature is that all of us tend to put off living. We are all dreaming of some magical rose garden over the horizon instead of enjoying the roses that are blooming outside our windows today.",
      "Everyone wants stuff. We wake up every day with a list of wishes a mile long and maybe we spend our lives trying to make those wishes come true, but just because we want them doesn't mean we need them to be happy.",
      "Sam was the only member of the party who had not been over the river before. He had a strange feeling as the slow gurgling stream slipped by: his old life lay behind him in the mists, dark adventure lay in front.",
      "The place to improve the world is first in one's own heart and head and hands, and then to work outward from there. Other people can talk about how to expand the destiny of mankind. I just want to talk about how to fix a motorcycle. I think that what I have to say has more lasting value.",
      "We imagine that when we are thrown out of our usual ruts all is lost, but it is only then that what is new and good begins. While there is life there is happiness. There is much, much before us.",
      "Nothing makes time pass or shortens the way like a thought that absorbs in itself all the faculties of the one who is thinking. External existence is then like a sleep of which this thought is the dream. Under its influence, time has no more measure, space has no more distance.",
      "When for years you wake up to having to win every battle every day, to prove that you are the best at everything... I started to worry what would happen if it turned out that I wasn't the best. I didn't want to worry...",
      "Well, if that's how you feel about it, then that's how you feel about it. Is that how you feel about it?",
      "The last man on Earth sat alone in a room. There was a knock on the door.",
      "He supposed that even in Hell, people got an occasional sip of water, if only so they could appreciate the full horror of unrequited thirst when it set in again.",
      "I'll close my eyes. Then I won't see the love you don't feel when you're holding me. Morning will come, and I'll do what's right. Just give me till then to give up this fight.",
      "Remember that humor is written backwards. That means you first find the cliche you want to work on, then build a story around it.",
      "Now and again we try to just stay alive, maybe we'll turn it all around 'cause it's not too late. It's never too late.",
      "We never get to change the past. We never get to know the future. No reason to wish for one place rather than another; no reason to say I wish I were home, or I wish I were in an exotic new place that is not my home. They will all be the same as this place. Here the experience of existing comes clear. This world is our body.",
      "A straight line is said to have been cut in extreme and mean ratio when, as the whole line is to the greater segment, so is the greater to the lesser.",
      "Why did I do it? Mainly because people said it was impossible, and that's what my life is all about: breaking limitations and showing people what our memories are capable of.",
      "The example of painting can teach us not only how to manage our own work, but how to work together. A lot of the great art of the past is the work of multiple hands, though there may only be one name on the wall next to it in the museum.",
      "I can hear the soft breathing of the girl that I love as she lies here beside me asleep with the night. And her hair, in a fine mist floats on my pillow, reflecting the glow of the winter moonlight.",
      "And the hardest part was letting go, not taking part was the hardest part. And the strangest thing was waiting for that bell to ring. It was the strangest start.",
      "For my hope was founded on a fat man in Bree; and my fear was founded on the cunning of Sauron. But fat men who sell ale have many calls to answer; and the power of Sauron is still less than fear makes it.",
      "It is not despair, for despair is only for those who see the end beyond all doubt. We do not.",
      "We all start out knowing magic. We are born with whirlwinds, forest fires, and comets inside us. We are born able to sing to birds and read the clouds and see our destiny in grains of sand. But then we get the magic educated right out of our souls.",
      "We've wounded this mountain. It's our duty to close her wounds. It's the least we can do to show our gratitude for all the wealth she's given us. If you guys don't want to help me, I'll do it alone.",
      "I've never really had much of an imagination. But still I would try to picture the exact moment when the beating of my heart would no longer be going on inside my head.",
      "And I taught myself how to forget that sometimes life will try to convince you there's such a thing as regret. But I found it to be a lie, the same lie I found when I looked in your eyes after it was said and done.",
      "If you had one shot to sit on your lazy butt, and watch all the TV you ever wanted, until your brain turned to mush. Would you go for it, or just let it slip?",
      "I shall die here. Every last inch of me shall perish. Except one. An inch. It's small and it's fragile and it's the only thing in the world worth having. We must never lose it, or sell it, or give it away. We must never let them take it from us.",
      "I've never been to this part of the castle, at least while awake. I sleepwalk you see, that's why I wear shoes to bed.",
      "Look into my eyes and it's easy to see, one and one make two, two and one make three, it was destiny. Once every hundred thousand years or so, when the sun doth shine and the moon doth glow and the grass doth grow.",
      "It's been rainy and windy for seven days straight. I've been going to bed early and getting up late. I look out my window and it's one shade of gray. My wife and my kids don't have much to say. A man out of work only gets in the way.",
      "In the midst of friends, home, and kind parents, she was alone.",
      "She would follow, her dream of love, the dictates of her heart that told her he was her all in all, the only man in all the world for her for love was the master guide. Come what might she would be wild, untrammelled, free.",
      "It seemed funny to me that the sunset she saw from her patio and the one I saw from the back steps was the same one. Maybe the two different worlds we lived in weren't so different. We saw the same sunset.",
      "When you hit rock-bottom, you still have a way to go until the abyss.",
      "It was not the brutality of what occurred next that changed my mind and brought home to me the full meaning of fear. It was the brilliance of it.",
      "I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.",
      "There is a theory, for which there is much to be said, that gold and gems were valued originally on account of their supposed magical properties.",
      "Every day when you're walking down the street, everybody that you meet has an original point of view. And I say hey, hey! What a wonderful kind of day, where you can learn to work and play, and get along with each other.",
      "In the beginning, the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.",
      "I want you to know that the day you saw something in me, my whole life changed.",
      "Your silence furnishes a dark house. But even at the risk of burning, the moth always seeks the light.",
      "It was the last that remained of a past whose annihilation had not taken place because it was still in a process of annihilation, consuming itself from within, ending at every moment but never ending its ending.",
      "The gentleman cannot be appreciated in small things but is acceptable in great matters. A small man is not acceptable in great matters but can be appreciated in small things.",
      "There was no reason for me to stay in the real world any longer. In the real world, it didn't matter if I was there or not. When I realized that, I was no longer afraid of losing my body.",
      "There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne. You and your friends better batten down the hatches, because when it hits, you're all gonna wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little for the rest of us.",
      "I breathed in my new surroundings. The air smelled different here, I don't know whether it was the desert air or the dry trees or just that I was far away from the stink of the city, but I liked it.",
      "My spirit's made up of the ocean, and the sky, and the sun, and the moon, and all my eyes can see. I cannot go back to your land of gloom, where black jagged shadows remind me of the coming of your doom. I want my own land.",
      "If I could go back to the day we met, what would I do? Perhaps I would smile with a kinder face. And maybe, when our eyes met, I would laugh even more. Then everything definitely would have gone better from the beginning. But life is a combination of miracles. If even one of them were different, then everything would change.",
      "Why is it, every time something terrible happens, everyone tells you the worst thing that ever happened to them, as though that makes it easier?",
      "Let me photograph you in this light, in case it is the last time that we might be exactly like we were before we realized we were sad of getting old.",
      "So much of this story is about human will, about what we can do when we come up against forces bigger than any of us. Whatever your beliefs or your lack thereof, we will live only one version of this life, and where and when that life starts determines so much.",
      "There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure 'cause you know sometimes words have two meanings. In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings, sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.",
      "You gotta see it to believe it, the sky never looked so blue it's so hard to leave it, but that's what I always do. So I keep thinking back to a time under the canyon moon.",
      "Learn to light a candle in the darkest moments of someone's life. Be the light that helps others see; it is what gives life its deepest significance.",
      "What I think is if you can't figure out how to have a simple date with a woman who's already agreed to go out with you, then maybe you don't deserve to go out with her in the first place. How's that for advice?",
      "You cannot fly with the eagles if you continue to scratch with the turkeys.",
      "They say there is a person who will tell you how to survive in this land... Oh, wait. That's me.",
      "When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today I'm gonna read it to you.",
      "It's important in life to conclude things properly. Only then can you let go. Otherwise you are left with words you should have said but never did, and your heart is heavy with remorse.",
      "The journey doesn't end here. Death is just another path, one that we all must take. The grey rain-curtain of this world rolls back, and all turns to silver glass, and then you see it.",
      "Sometimes we get sad about things and we don't like to tell other people that we are sad about them. We like to keep it a secret. Or sometimes, we are sad but we really don't know why we are sad, so we say we aren't sad but we really are.",
      "And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.",
      "You shared something horrible with me, gave me no time to process it, and while I was taking it in you not only attacked my integrity, you made me feel ashamed of myself.",
      "I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.",
      "Everyone gets everything he wants. I wanted a mission, and for my sins, they gave me one. Brought it up to me like room service. It was a real choice mission, and when it was over, I never wanted another.",
      "Just let me wake up in the morning to the smell of new mown hay, to laugh and cry, to live and die in the brightness of my day. I want to hear the pealing bell of distant churches sing. But most of all please free me from this aching metal ring and open out this cage towards the sun.",
      "You must have a goal because it's just as difficult to reach a destination you don't have, as it is to come back from a place you've never been.",
      "You can't see the changes we see, we who have been with him for so long. Do you think any of us want to look into his eyes for the next hundred years if he loses you?",
      "My heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds that rise from the lake to the trees. My heart wants to sigh like a chime that flies from a church on a breeze, to laugh like a brook when it trips and falls over stones on its way, to sing through the night like a lark who is learning to pray.",
      "I can hear those echoes in the wind at night calling me back in time, back to you, in a place far away where the water meets the sky.",
      "Yes, it was her he was looking at, and there was meaning in his look. His eyes burned into her as though they would search her through and through, read her very soul.",
      "This was supposed to be a question. Not a poem, confession or whatever it's become. I just want to know if you would listen with me to the sound of our heartbeats.",
      "I have a dream, a song to sing, to help me cope with anything. If you see the wonder of a fairy tale you can take the future even if you fail.",
      "You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you see is every negative thing ten miles down the road.",
      "Although his voice was also broken by uncertainty and his hands seemed to doubt the existence of things, it was evident that he came from the world where men could still sleep and remember.",
      "Give me a lifetime of promises and a world of dreams. Speak the language of love like you know what it means. You're simply the best, better than all the rest, better than anyone I ever met.",
      "I don't feel like that now. I feel that as long as the Shire lies behind, safe and comfortable, I shall find wandering more bearable: I shall know that somewhere there is a firm foothold, even if my feet cannot stand there again.",
      "I have noticed even people who claim everything is predestined, and that we can do nothing to change it, look before they cross the road.",
      "The thing under my bed waiting to grab my ankle isn't real. I know that, and I also know that if I'm careful to keep my foot under the covers, it will never be able to grab my ankle.",
      "Maybe our old wounds teach us something. They remind us where we've been and what we've overcome. They teach us lessons about what to avoid in the future. That's what we like to think. But that's not always the way it is. Sometimes there are things we just have to learn over again.",
      "It is now time to make it unclear. To write off lines that don't make sense. I love myself better than you. I know it's wrong so what should I do? And one more special message to go, and then I'm done, and I can go home. I love myself better than you. I know it's wrong so what should I do?",
      "You know when I was your age, I went out to fishing with all my brothers and my father, and everybody. And I was the only one who caught a fish.",
      "The highlander seemed to float through life very much the same as a cloud in an empty sky, touching nothing, leaving no trace of his passing.",
      "His ear heard more than what was said to him, and his slow speech had overtones not of thought, but of understanding beyond thought.",
      "Nobody listens anymore. I can't talk to the walls because they're yelling at me, I can't talk to my wife; she listens to the walls. I just want someone to hear what I have to say. And maybe if I talk long enough it'll make sense. And I want you to teach me to understand what I read.",
      "It's not about changing the world. It's about doing our best to leave the world the way it is. It's about respecting the will of others, and believing in your own.",
      "Perhaps love is like a resting place, a shelter from the storm. It exists to give you comfort. It is there to keep you warm. And in those times of trouble when you are most alone, the memory of love will bring you home.",
      "Did you know? There are three kinds of aces. Those who seek strength, those who live for pride, and those who can read the tide of battle.",
      "If all these dreams might find their way into my day to day scene I'd be under the impression I was somewhere in between. With only two, just me and you. Not so many things we got to do or places we got to be.",
      "After several hours, Joe finally gave up on logic and reason, and simply told the cabinet that he could talk to plants and that they wanted water.",
      "I'll tell you a riddle. You're waiting for a train, a train that will take you far away. You know where you hope this train will take you, but you don't know for sure. But it doesn't matter. How can it not matter to you where that train will take you?",
      "I wanted to understand as much as I could about the procedure as possible. I think it's important for my job to understand the inner workings of the work that we do, well not that I do, but the work that is done by people where I also work, the work of my colleagues.",
      "But older than me now, more constant, more real, and the fur, and the mouth, and the innocence turned to hair and contentment that hangs in abasement - a woman now standing where once there was only a girl.",
      "If you want to save yourself the ticket price, go into the kitchen, cue up a male choir singing the music of hell, and get a kid to start banging pots and pans together. Then close your eyes and use your imagination.",
      "Pause you who read this, and think for a moment of the long chain of iron or gold, of thorns or flowers, that would never have bound you, but for the formation of the first link on one memorable day.",
      "They often wish that people would just once and for all work out where the hell they wanted to be.",
      "I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail.",
      "All of these moments just might find their way into my dreams tonight. But I know that they'll be gone when the morning light sings and brings new things.",
      "And I will keep you safe and strong and shelter from the storm. No matter where it's barren, a dream is being born. I'll be everyone you need, no matter if the sun don't shine or if the skies are blue. No matter what the end is my life began with you.",
      "You know a dream is like a river ever changing as it flows and a dreamer's just a vessel that must follow where it goes. Trying to learn from what's behind you and never knowing what's in store makes each day a constant battle just to stay between the shores.",
      "The major difference between a thing that might go wrong and a thing that cannot possibly go wrong is that when a thing that cannot possibly go wrong goes wrong it usually turns out to be impossible to get at or repair.",
      "There are many people who reach their conclusions about life like schoolboys; they cheat their master by copying the answer out of a book without having worked out the sum for themselves.",
      "When the light is running low, and the shadows start to grow, and the places that you know seem like fantasy, there's a light inside your soul that's still shining in the cold with the truth - the promise in our hearts. Don't forget. I'm with you in the dark.",
      "I do not think there is any thrill that can go through the human heart like that felt by the inventor as he sees some creation of the brain unfolding to success. Such emotions make a man forget food, sleep, friends, love, everything.",
      "I came back home from work tonight and saw you there, with a train set in your hands and paint in your hair. And I just saw you this morning but I don't care; I'm saying let's never be apart again.",
      "Anywhere can be paradise, as long as you have the will to live. After all, you are alive, so you will always have the chance to be happy.",
      "We got questions we should not ask, but how would you feel if I told you I loved you? It's just something that I want to do.",
      "If I were a rich man, I'd build a big tall house with rooms by the dozen right in the middle of the town. A fine tin roof with real wooden floors below. There would be one long staircase just going up and one even longer coming down and one more leading nowhere, just for show.",
      "I etched your name in the clouds but it was lost when the thunder cried. I etched your name in the surf but it was stolen by the rising tide. I etched your name in my heart and there it will forever reside.",
      "The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword. If you would take a man's life, you owe it to him to look into his eyes and hear his final words. And if you cannot bear to do that, then perhaps the man does not deserve to die.",
      "I wrote about how last weekend my parents and I waited in line at the movies for an hour, and when we finally got up to the ticket booth lady, they were sold out! Isn't that sad?",
      "Nice things don't happen in storybooks. Or when they do happen, something bad happens next. Because otherwise the story would be boring, and no one would read it.",
      "There was a time when I was alone, nowhere to go and no place to call home. My only friend was the man in the moon and even sometimes he would go away, too. Then one night, as I closed my eyes, I saw a shadow flying high. He came to me with the sweetest smile, told me he wanted to talk for a while.",
      "You can't get back what you've lost, what's important now is what it is that you still have.",
      "Some say the world will end in fire, some say in ice. From what I've tasted of desire, I hold with those who favor fire. But if it had to perish twice, I think I know enough of hate, to say that for destruction ice is also great, and would suffice.",
      "Now I want you to think and stop being a smart aleck. A man's attitude goes some ways - the way his life will be. Is that something you agree with? So since you agree, you must be someone who does not care about the good life.",
      "And one day I knew I had to come back here. I had to come back and get on the merry-go-round, and eat cotton candy, and listen to a band concert. Just stop and breathe, and close my eyes and smell and listen.",
      "Someone once told me that time was a predator that stalked us all our lives. I rather believe that time is a companion who goes with us on the journey and reminds us to cherish every moment, because it will never come again. What we leave behind is not as important as how we've lived. After all Number One, we're only mortal.",
      "But the law of loving others could not be discovered by reason, because it is unreasonable.",
      "For string theory to make sense, the universe should have nine space dimensions and one time dimension, for a total of ten dimensions.",
      "I don't like work - no man does - but I like what is in the work - the chance to find yourself. Your own reality - for yourself, not for others - what no other man can ever know. They can only see the mere show, and never can tell what it really means.",
      "But on this particular day I did not like the color of the sky.",
      "I'm in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, and I am in love with you.",
      "On the page, punctuation performs its grammatical function, but in the mind of the reader it does more than that. It tells the reader how to hum the tune.",
      "But the house gets so quiet sitting here wishing for just an hour or two alone with you. Well, it's always too personal, always too close to comment. They all mention how tired you look and you realize you haven't said a word in hours. Well, who's hiding it?",
      "We passionately long that there may be another life in which we shall be similar to what we are here below. But we do not pause to reflect that, even without waiting for that other life, in this life, after a few years we are unfaithful to what we have been, to what we wished to remain immortally.",
      "I can't have been there when brains were handed 'round or get past the cover of your books profound and some of your friends think it's really unsound that you're ever seen talking to me.",
      "Getting into trouble is not a bad thing. It's proof that someone's watching you. I've got my eyes on you, so feel free to mess up as much as you want.",
      "The boy had been working for the crystal merchant for almost a month, and he could see that it wasn't exactly the kind of job that would make him happy. The merchant spent the entire day mumbling behind the counter, telling the boy to be careful with the pieces and not to break anything.",
      "And in the night, when the dog barks at shadows, tell him not to be afraid of what he cannot see or the things he does not yet understand. There is mystery everywhere. Beneath rocks, there is damp earth and an army of ants planning a revolution.",
      "What a charming reconciler and peacemaker money is!",
      "Life is not the amount of breaths you take. It's the moments that take your breath away.",
      "We climbed, he first and I behind, until through a small round opening ahead of us, I saw the lovely things the heavens hold, and we came out to see once more the stars.",
      "Death really did not matter to him but life did, and therefore the sensation he felt when they gave their decision was not a feeling of fear but of nostalgia.",
      "One more turn and I'll settle the score. A rubber fire screams into the night. Crash and burn is what you're gonna do. I am the master of the asphalt fight.",
      "Being in a minority, even in a minority of one, did not make you mad. There was truth and there was untruth, and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world, you were not mad.",
      "I saw the light fade from the sky, on the wind I heard a sigh. As the snowflakes cover my fallen brothers, I will say this last goodbye. Night is now falling, so ends this day. The road is now calling, and I must away. Over hill and under tree, through lands where never light has shone, by silver streams that run down to the sea.",
      "The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which.",
      "Life is very short, and there's no time for fussing and fighting, my friend. I have always thought that it's a crime, so I will ask you once again, try to see it my way. Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong.",
      "In a way fighting was just like using magic. You said the words, and they altered the universe. By merely speaking you could create damage and pain, cause tears to fall, drive people away, make yourself feel better, make your life worse.",
      "All these fears and all this love, all you've given me, it's not enough. All my dreams and all this stuff, all made real... it's not enough.",
      "I'd like to see the world for once all standing hand in hand and hear them echo through the hills for peace throughout the land.",
      "It was the most horrible, the most repellent thing she had ever seen, far more nauseating than anything she had ever imagined with her conscious mind, or that had ever tormented her in her most terrible nightmares.",
      "I was never cheating. You connected dots that weren't there, you gave attention to the thoughts I'd never wear; it's not my style. Even though it's so clear to me, you shouldn't base the future on the past, I know you really want this thing to last.",
      "Words bend our thinking to infinite paths of self-delusion, and the fact that we spend most of our mental lives in brain mansions built of words means that we lack the objectivity necessary to see the terrible distortion of reality which language brings.",
      "I'll light the fire, you place the flowers in the vase that you bought today. Staring at the fire for hours and hours while I listen to you. Play your love songs all night long for me, only for me.",
      "Tonight I'm making deals with the devil, and I know it's gonna get me in trouble. Just as long as you know you got me.",
      "To graduate you need my course, dear boy. So it seems I have something to say about what you do and where you go. So from now on you and Mitch are going to spend every waking moment in the lab. You will solve my power problem, and you will solve it by my deadline.",
      "Well, this is the end of a perfect day, near the end of a journey, too. But it leaves a thought that is big and strong, with a wish that is kind and true. For memory has painted this perfect day with colors that never fade, and we find at the end of a perfect day the soul of a friend we've made.",
      "That'll be a dispute to the end of time, Mr. Brown: whether it's better to do the right thing for the wrong reason or the wrong thing for the right reason.",
      "You all have your own distinct personal backgrounds. Of course some of you come from rich families, some from poor families. But circumstances beyond your control like that shouldn't determine who you are. You must all realize what you're worth on your own.",
      "The new-born child does not realize that his body is more a part of himself than surrounding objects, and will play with his toes without any feeling that they belong to him more than the rattle by his side; and it is only by degrees, through pain, that he understands the fact of the body.",
      "Come let me love you, let me give my life to you, let me drown in your laughter, let me die in your arms, let me lay down beside you, let me always be with you.",
      "Let me finish. I thought I wanted to be alone tonight, and then I realized that I didn't because I wanted to be with my family. If you can't keep it together tonight of all nights, then as far as I'm concerned you can all rot in hell.",
      "And for the first time there's no pain in my life. It's been a long hard road that I've gone. We had a good thing and it made me a man. And I know you got me going. Pardon me, my feelings are showing. I'm only saying what's on my mind.",
      "Benjamin was the oldest animal on the farm, and the worst tempered. He seldom talked, and when he did, it was usually to make some cynical remark - for instance, he would say that God had given him a tail to keep the flies off, but that he would sooner have had no tail and no flies.",
      "Saying \"I love you\" is not the words I want to hear from you. It's not that I want you not to say, but if you only knew how easy it would be to show me how you feel. More than words is all you have to do to make it real. Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me.",
      "There are places I'll remember all my life, though some have changed. Some forever, not for better. Some have gone and some remain. All these places have their moments with lovers and friends I still can recall.",
      "The past is always with us. Where we come from, what we go through, how we go through it; all this matters. Like at the end of the book, ya know, boats and tides and all. It's like you can change up, right, you can say you're somebody new, you can give yourself a whole new story.",
      "I am doing good to the poor, but I differ in opinion about the means. I think the best way of doing good to the poor is not making them easy in poverty, but leading them or driving them out of it.",
      "At last, we finally meet. I have something for you, Chancellor; a farewell gift. For all the things you've done, for the things you might have done, and for the only thing you have left.",
      "It's a thousand pages, give or take a few. I'll be writing more in a week or two. I could make it longer if you like the style. I can change it 'round, and I want to be a paperback writer.",
      "The voice of anatomy, like the voice of all nature, never reaches the mental ear of the Great Commoner. It is the novel province of anatomy to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth about the structure, the origin and the history of man.",
      "If at some point in life, you made a mistake or keep failing over and over again, and you can't help but think it's useless and you're a good for nothing; remember, you're only taking a detour. And I'm sure further along your path will come a day where you think, \"It was a good life experience.\" That's why it'll be fine.",
      "It doesn't matter what I say, so long as I sing with inflection that makes you feel I'll convey some inner truth or vast reflection. But I've said nothing so far, and I can keep it up for as long as it takes.",
      "I have moments like that a lot, when my brain falls asleep or something, and the next thing I know I've missed something, as if a puzzle piece fell out of the universe and left me staring at the blank place behind it.",
      "I've tried to hide it so that no one knows, but I guess it shows. When you look into my eyes, what you did and where you are coming from, I don't care as long as you love me.",
      "Life is a storm, my young friend. You will bask in the sunlight one moment, be shattered on the rocks the next. What makes you a man is what you do when that storm comes. You must look into that storm and shout as you did in Rome. Do your worst, for I will do mine! Then the fates will know you as we know you.",
      "Don't tell me what's in, don't tell me how to write, don't tell me how to win this fight. It isn't your right, isn't your life, it isn't your right to take the only thing that's mine.",
      "Why is it that when one man builds a wall, the next man immediately needs to know what's on the other side?",
      "They can only see the mere show, and never can tell what it really means.",
      "In general, people only ask for advice that they may not follow it; or, if they should follow it, that they may have somebody to blame for having given it.",
      "People aren't all perfect. They're weak, ugly, and they get jealous and try to bring others down. Oddly enough, the better you are, the harder it is to live. That's why I'm going to change this world and the people in it...",
      "I only lose my fear when I run. I won't lose a tear when I run. I won't find a heart so I run. And now the time is right so we run.",
      "I walk a mile with a smile and I don't know, I don't care where I am, but I know it's alright. Jump the tracks, can't get back. I don't know anyone around here, but I'm safe this time, 'cause when you tell me stupid things, like you do, I have to change the rules.",
      "You can have my isolation, you can have the hate that it brings, you can have my absence of faith, you can have my everything.",
      "People come, people go - they'll drift in and out of your life, almost like characters in a favorite book. When you finally close the cover, the characters have told their story and you start up again with another book, complete with new characters and adventures. Then you find yourself focusing on the new ones, not the ones from the past.",
      "I just hope you're lying next to somebody who knows how to love you like me. There must be a good reason that you're gone. Every now and then I think you might want me to come show up at your door, but I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong.",
      "One day she left without a word, she took away the sun. And in the dark she left behind, I knew what she had done. She'd left me for another, it's a common tale but true.",
      "For the days of my life have vanished like smoke, and my bones are parched like ash, and let all my impurities be as fuel for that fire until nothing remains but the light alone.",
      "You boys are in so much trouble. I can't leave you alone for one second. I guess next time I go out, I'll have to chain you to the floor and tie you to the oven. You don't even pretend to listen. You might as well cut off your ears and throw them in the trash for as long as you use them. You are grounded for the next month!",
      "Your face has fallen sad now, for you know the time is nigh. But when I must remove your wings and you, you must try to fly. Come sail your ships around me and burn your bridges down. We make a little history, baby, every time you come around.",
      "I took a walk alone last night, I looked up at the stars to try and find an answer in my life. I chose a star for me, I chose a star for him, I chose two stars for my kids and one star for my wife.",
      "Once you free your mind about a concept of harmony and music being correct you can do whatever you want. So, nobody told me what to do, and there was no preconception of what to do.",
      "What have I got to do to make you love me? What have I got to do to make you care? What do I do when lightning strikes me and I wake to find that you're not there?",
      "I must not fear. Fear is the mind killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when my fear is gone I will turn and face fear's path, and only I will remain.",
      "Wealth can be very empty when you don't have someone to share it with. But by the time I realized that, no one would have me except men who wanted my money more than I did.",
      "Got me thinking. I know what I love too. Family and friends. All the ones here and all ones gone. I love my dog, and this orchard, and a crumbledown house.",
      "Under the lights when everything goes. Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close when we move, well, you already know.",
      "If you've had half as much fun watching the show as we've had doing it, well then we've had twice as much fun doing the show as you've had watching it.",
      "I want adventure in the great wide somewhere. I want it more than I can tell. And for once it might be grand to have someone understand; I want so much more than they've got planned.",
      "If you're looking for the word that means caring about someone beyond all rationality and wanting them to have everything they want no matter how much it destroys you, it's love. And when you love someone you don't stop, ever. Even when people roll their eyes, and call you crazy. Even then. Especially then.",
      "So if this was a touching romantic story this is probably where a new feeling would wash over me and suddenly we would be furiously making out with the fire of a thousand suns. But this isn't a touching romantic story.",
      "Focus your attention on the Now and tell me what problem you have at this moment. I am not getting any answer because it is impossible to have a problem when your attention is fully in the Now. A situation that needs to be either dealt with or accepted - yes.",
      "Take one moment to escape, it will change your mood when you're walking on the moon. Chase your happy place, it will change your groove when you're dancing on the moon. When we dance again, all our troubles seems to fade away. This is how I feel when you take me to some levels that I've never been.",
      "You don't need money, don't take fame. Don't need no credit card to ride this train. It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes, but it might just save your life. That's the power of love.",
      "He's got to make his own mistakes and learn to mend the mess he makes. He's old enough to know what's right but young enough not to choose it. He's noble enough to win the world but weak enough to lose it. He's a New World man...",
      "Blackbird singing in the dead of night, take these broken wings and learn to fly. All your life you were only waiting for this moment to arise.",
      "I remember way back then when everything was true and when we would have such a very good time. Such a fine time, such a happy time.",
      "It's a fallen situation when all eyes are turned in and a love isn't flowing the way it could have been. You brought it all on but it feels so wrong. You brought it all on. I don't believe this song.",
      "Language does for intelligence what the wheel does for the feet and the body. It enables them to move from thing to thing with greater ease and speed and ever less involvement.",
      "A year has passed since I wrote my note but I should have known this right from the start: only hope can keep me together; love can mend your life but love can break your heart.",
      "Sometimes I wish I could turn back time, impossible as it may seem, but I wish I could so bad. Quit playing games with my heart. I live my life the way to keep you coming back to me. Everything I do is for you, so what is it that you can't see?",
      "Social scientists sometimes talk about the concept of \"identity\". It is the idea that you have a particular vision of the kind of person you are, and you feel awful when you do things that are out of line with that vision.",

      "Imagine you were born without a memory. Who would you be? You could be nothing; if you didn't have memory, you wouldn't be able to function in our world.",
      "We've just begun to learn about the water and its secrets, just as we've only touched on outer space. We don't entirely rule out the possibility that there might be some form of life on another planet, and why not some entirely different form of life in a world we already know is inhabited by millions of living creatures?",
      "In a hamlet of ten households, there are bound to be those who are my equal in doing their best for others and in being trustworthy in what they say, but they are unlikely to be as eager to learn as I am.",
      "I know there's something in the wake of your smile. I get a notion from the look in your eyes. You've built a love but that love falls apart. Your little piece of heaven turns to dark.",
      "Where are those happy days, they seem so hard to find. I tried to reach for you, but you have closed your mind. Whatever happened to our love? I wish I understood. It used to be so nice, it used to be so good.",
      "To put things simply, if your past makes your present... Then your present can and will make your future. When you think about it that way... You absolutely have the potential to be anything you want to be.",
      "If the world thinks you're a monster, what does it matter? The world is wrong. But when you start to think of yourself as a monster...",
      "Even if you lose a spell card battle, you win if you feel good. It's a game after all. A game isn't there to entertain you. You enjoy the game yourself. Maybe when you reach the point when you can enjoy anything, you see the true glamour of the spell card for the first time.",
      "You're missing the point. There's no throne, there is no version of this where you come out on top. Maybe your army comes and maybe it's too much for us, but it's all on you. Because if we can't protect the Earth, you can be damned well sure we'll avenge it.",
      "The spirit and the senses so easily grow dead to the impressions of the beautiful and the perfect that one ought everyday to hear a little song, read a good poem, see a fine picture and if it were possible, to speak a few reasonable words.",
      "Give me reasons we should be complete. You should be with him, I can't compete. You looked at me like I was someone else, oh well, can't you see? I don't wanna slow dance in the dark.",
      "Love isn't just wanting another person the way you want to own an object you see in a store. That's just desire. You want to have it around, take it home and set it up somewhere in the apartment like a lamp.",
      "There is something about yourself that you don't know. Something that you will deny even exists, until it's too late to do anything about it. It's the only reason you get up in the morning. We share an addiction. We're approval junkies. We're all in it for the slap on the back and the gold watch.",
      "You're not a bad person. You are a very good person who bad things have happened to, you understand. Besides the world isn't split into good people and Death Eaters. We've all got both light, and dark inside of us, what matters is the part we choose to act on. That's who we really are.",
      "I wish that I was born a thousand years ago. I wish that I'd sailed the darkened seas on a great big clipper ship, going from this land to that in a sailor's suit and cap. Away from the big city where man cannot be free of all the evils of this town and of himself and those around.",
      "In most cases, there is more to be gained by maximizing the performance of the driver than tricking out the car. The most important factor is the driver, the ultimate control system of a race car.",
      "She can kill with a smile, she can wound with her eyes, she can ruin your faith with her casual lies, and she only reveals what she wants you to see. She hides like a child, but she's always a woman to me.",
      "You have two choices: you can keep running and hiding and blaming the world for your problems, or you can stand up for yourself and decide to be somebody important.",
      "It is at this point in our story that along comes a spider.",
      "For the first time the magnitude of what he had taken came home to him. How could you communicate with the future? It was of its nature impossible. Either the future would resemble the present, in which case it would not listen to him: or it would be different from it, and his predicament would be meaningless.",
      "It is truly amazing what you can do when you believe in your own ability. That's why you need faith - a deep down, dogged belief that, regardless of the evidence, you are going to make it! You are going to achieve what you have set out to accomplish. You are going to make a difference in this life.",
      "Who cares if we don't see the sun shine ever again? I want you more than any blue sky. The weather can go crazy.",
      "Baby, ever wondered why I could make you laugh and cry? Eclipsing all your summer skies, some things never change. And I need it more than love, and I love it more than life, and I want those stars above to shine this night.",
      "Again, I go back to the working really hard to get someone else a piece thing. The payoff is never gonna be as great for you as it is for them. Don't you think you've been using these birds to avoid interacting with your own species for long enough?",
      "I have dreamt in my life, dreams that have stayed with me ever after, and changed my ideas; they have gone through and through me, like wine through water, and altered the color of my mind. And this is one: I'm going to tell it - but take care not to smile at any part of it.",
      "By love you mean big lightning bolts to the heart, where you can't eat and you can't work, and you just run off and get married and make babies. The reason you haven't felt it is because it doesn't exist. What you call love was invented by guys like me.",
      "Sally and I did not know what to say. Should we tell her the things that went on there that day? Should we tell her about it? Now, what should we do? Well, what would you do if your mother asked you?",
      "There before me was a woman who had finally, after all this time, made it to the start line, at the absolute worst moment imaginable. It was truly a tragic sight of a truly hopeless girl who had just begun her first love when it was far too late.",
      "As you decide, you shall be left as you were before, and neither richer nor wiser, unless the sense of service rendered to a man in mortal distress may be counted as a kind of riches of the soul.",
      "I realized that back then, the reason I wanted to become human, was that I really just wanted to have friends. Now, I just want to be a monster that can help Luffy.",
      "We can now get these kids to buy just about anything. We can have them chasing a new trend every week. And that is good for the economy. And what's good for the economy is good for the country.",
      "Give me the child... Through dangers untold and hardships unnumbered, I have fought my way here to the castle beyond the goblin city to take back the child which you have stolen. For my will is as strong as yours and my kingdom as great. You have no power over me.",
      "Breathe, breathe in the air. Don't be afraid to care. Leave but don't leave me. Look around, choose your own ground. For long you live and high you fly. And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry. And all you touch and all you see is all your life will ever be.",
      "You think you're any different from me, or your friends, or this tree? If you listen hard enough, you can hear every living thing breathing together. You can feel everything growing. We're all living together, even if most folks don't act like it. We all have the same roots, and we are all branches of the same tree.",
      "In your heart I see the start of every night and every day. In your eyes I get lost, I get washed away. Just as long as I'm here in your arms I could be in no better place.",
      "The only ones who should kill are those prepared to be killed.",
      "If one must drink, then let one drink thrice a month, for more is bad. If one gets drunk twice a month, it is better; if one gets drunk once a month, that is better still; and if one doesn't drink at all, that is the best of all.",
      "In short, our gentleman became so caught up in reading that he spent his nights reading from dusk 'til dawn and his days reading from sunrise to sunset, and so with too little sleep and too much reading his brains dried up, causing him to lose his mind.",
      "For just one second, look at your life and see how perfect it is. Stop looking for the next secret door that is going to lead you to your real life. Stop waiting. This is it: there's nothing else. It's here, and you'd better decide to enjoy it or you're going to be miserable wherever you go, for the rest of your life, forever.",
      "For someone who was never meant for this world, I must confess I'm suddenly having a hard time leaving it.",
      "For every man there is a cause which he would gladly die for. Defend the right to have a place to which he can belong to. And every man will fight with his bare hands in desperation. And shed his blood to stem the flood to barricade invasion.",
      "There are so many different ways to be connected to people. There are the people you feel this unspoken connection to, even though there's not even a word for it. There's the people who you've known forever who know you in this way that other people can't because they've seen you change... they've let you change.",
      "I am Dracula and I welcome you to my house. I must apologize for not being here to greet you personally, but I trust you've found everything you needed.",
      "I will rain down silver and gold for you. I will shatter the black night, break it open, and pour out a million stars. Turn away from the darkness, the madness, the pain. Open your eyes and know that I am here. That I remember and hope. Open your eyes and look at the light.",
      "There can be no light without the dark, and so it is with magic. Myself, I always strive to live within the light. Is that what you told Tom Riddle, sir, when he came asking questions?",
      "That is right, but I held something back. I see some real genius in your flying, Maverick, but I can't say that in there. I was afraid that everyone in the tax trailer would see right through me, and I just don't want anyone to know that I've fallen for you.",
      "I know that you wanna but you can't 'cause you gotta stay cool in the corner when the truth is that you wanna move.",
      "Well, the real reason that you've been sent over here is because they wanted you to be evaluated... to determine whether or not you are mentally ill. This is the real reason. Why do you think they might think that?",
      "A good plan today is better than a perfect plan tomorrow.",
      "You spend your life in a dream that you can't escape, 'cause you live your life in a coma, you're never awake. If you'd open your eyes then maybe you'd see what's at stake. You're sleeping. You're sleeping.",
      "This is a life-or-death elimination match. The only way to survive... is to win. There can be no doubt that those are the rules of the game. Which is why I am bowing out of the game.",
      "For children love is a feeling; for adults, it is a decision. Children wait to learn if their love is true by seeing how long it lasts; adults make their love true by never wavering from their commitment.",
      "Our emotions cloud our perceptions. It's no wonder this library is the most wonderful place on earth to you, but other people don't see it that way.",
      "Never give up on everything if one thing is too hard. Never give up when it falls down; just go back to the start. Never give up on everything; never give up when you can still believe. Time after time we miss the chances for us to find a better life. No looking back, no pulling punches - this is the fact time after time.",
      "I needed all the feelings to stop boiling like a pot of dal and be cool enough for me to taste them.",
      "Although some men who were easy with their words said that it was worth sacrificing one's life for a night of love with such an arousing woman, the truth was that no one made any effort to do so.",
      "He always seemed to women different from what he was, and they loved in him not himself, but the man created by their imagination, whom they had been eagerly seeking all their lives; and afterwards, when they noticed their mistake, they loved him all the same.",
      "In the short term, it would make me happy to go play outside. In the long term, it would make me happier to do well at school and become successful. But in the very long term, I know which will make better memories.",
      "But I believe in true love, you know? I don't believe that everybody gets to keep their eyes or not get sick or whatever, but everybody should have true love, and it should last at least as long as your life does.",
      "Everybody knows in their bones that something is eternal, and that something has to do with human beings.",
      "Man, don't tell me how good I was. I just got away with it because I had a hangover. I was too mad to be scared and too sick to worry about it. You know that.",
      "Esteban stood at the front of the room, staring at the page. Then he lifted his head and looked at us. We cheered again, even louder this time. I don't know if any of us really understood his dad's poem. But for a long time after he'd finished reading, I thought about that army of ants, how they were coming together. Like us.",
      "Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go. So make the best of this test, and don't ask why; it's not a question, but a lesson learned in time. It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right. I hope you had the time of your life.",
      "You do not have to sit outside in the dark. If, however, you want to look at the stars, you will find that darkness is necessary. But the stars neither require nor demand it.",
      "I'm just not the guy for you. I mean, you need a guy who's happy and perky all the time. Maybe a guy who's had part of his brain removed and he thinks he's a bunny and you can go off and be bunnies together.",
      "Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers and that's how it's supposed to be. How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me? I'd love to go back to when we played as kids. But things change... that's the way it is.",
      "Like the generations of leaves, the lives of mortal men. Now the wind scatters the old leaves across the earth, now the living timber bursts with the new buds and spring comes 'round again. And so with men: as one generation comes to life, another dies away.",
      "In any new job there's always friction with your coworkers. They're wondering if the boss likes the new guy better, if he's going to make them look bad. In some jobs, that can get you a dark look in the break room; in other jobs, that can get you a bullet in the back of the head.",
      "The odds are that you will generally meet the worst of them. The reason is that men who have something going for them in their lives, men who passionately live life with a purpose, are usually too busy living their dreams to hang out \"trolling for chicks.\"",
      "How sweet it is to love someone, how right it is to care. How long it's been since yesterday, what about tomorrow, and what about our dreams and all the memories we share?",
      "I'm going to marry you on a mountaintop, and as we reach the peak, that's when the snow will stop. I'm going to look at you coming down that aisle that's made of sticks and stones, and we're both going to smile, 'cause our love has begun.",
      "The night's always waiting, still and unseen. The harder you focus, the darker it seems.",
      "A lot of people say they want to be great, but they're not willing to make the sacrifices necessary to achieve greatness. They have other concerns, whether important or not, and they spread themselves out. That's totally fine. After all, greatness is not for everybody.",
      "It's a basic truth of the human condition, that everybody lies. The only variable is about what. The weird thing about telling someone they're dying is that, it tends to focus their priorities. Find out what matters to them. What they're willing to die for... What they're willing to lie for.",
      "It's the job that's never started as takes longest to finish, as my old gaffer used to say.",
      "Perhaps love is like a window, perhaps an open door. It invites you to come closer. It wants to show you more. And even if you lose yourself, and don't know what to do, the memory of love will see you through.",
      "Owners of dogs will have noticed that, if you provide them with food and water and shelter and affection, they will think you are god. Whereas owners of cats are compelled to realize that, if you provide them with food and water and shelter and affection, they draw the conclusion that they are gods.",
      "Perhaps the most valuable result of all education is the ability to make yourself do the thing you have to do, when it ought to be done, whether you like it or not; it is the first lesson that ought to be learned; and however early a man's training begins, it is probably the last lesson that he learns thoroughly.",
      "But it is important to know this, to know your roots. To know where you started as a person. If not, your own life seems unreal to you. Like a puzzle. Like you have missed the beginning of a story and now you are in the middle of it, trying to understand.",
      "There's a feeling I get when I look to the west and my spirit is crying for leaving. In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees and the voices of those who stand looking.",
      "As my bones grew they did hurt. They hurt really bad. I tried hard to have a father but instead I had a dad. I just want you to know that I don't hate you anymore. There is nothing I could say that I haven't thought before.",
      "It's so relieving to know that you're leaving as soon as you get paid. It's so relaxing to hear you're asking wherever you get your way. It's so soothing to know that you'll sue me, this is starting to sound the same. I miss the comfort in being sad.",
      "I was born in a town that was straight out of a fairy tale. Many people died there, and when I walked away, I held hands with my other self. To me it seemed like we were the only two people in the world. Neither one of us possessed a real name.",
      "Here we go, another night out. Waited all week just to get out. Where do we come from? Do I know your name? Doesn't really matter; in this life we're all the same. Move for me, I'll move for you.",
      "But no matter how effective the lesson was, I never really used it after that. I didn't enjoy doing it that way. But it was interesting to know that things worked much differently from how I was brought up.",
      "I just told you the truth. I told you the truth the first time. You don't have to ask me again. I never do that. I always tell you the truth. If I did it, you would know. I took her out a couple of times.",
      "The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things. The good things don't always soften the bad things, but vice versa the bad things don't always spoil the good things or make them unimportant. And we definitely added to his pile of good things.",
      "I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool or find myself a rock and roll band that needs a helping hand.",
      "The most precious treasures we have in life are the images we store in the memory banks of our brains. The sum of these stored experiences is responsible for our sense of personal identity and our sense of connectedness to those around us.",
      "It's a funny thing, but people mostly have it backward. They think they live by what they want. But really, what guides them is what they're afraid of. What they don't want.",
      "Sometimes you are too ashamed to leave. That was true now. And sometimes you need too much to know the facts, and so humbly and stupidly you stay.",
      "People running everywhere, don't know the way to go, don't know where I am. Can't see past the next step, don't have to think past the last mile, have no time to look around. Just run around, run around and think why.",
      "I'd have wasted a lot of time and trouble before I learned that the best way to take all people, black or white, is to take them for what they think they are, then leave them alone.",
      "She's got eyes of the bluest skies as if they thought of rain. I hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain. Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place where as a child I'd hide and pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by.",
      "I have a small favor to ask regarding our impending wedding. Since all of my close friends will be out of town and we have had a previous conversation and our eyes have met on a number of occasions I was wondering if you'd consent to be my maid of honor.",
      "So I walk into the sun. I thought you'd be there, but you could fool anyone. In the red water dust, will I see you soon, or did we move on?",
      "You have to accept that sometimes that's how things happen in this world. People's opinions, their feelings, they go one way, then the other. It just so happens you grew up at a certain point in this process.",
      "Patience, he thought. So much of this was patience - waiting, and thinking and doing things right. So much of all this, so much of all living was patience and thinking.",
      "If I am to serve both as a waitress and the butt of jokes, I think I should make more money.",
      "She knew since she was little, the world would not sing her triumphs, but she took all of the stereotypes and put them in a chokehold until they breathed out the truth.",
      "I never thought I'd be able to do any of this stuff. But I can. Anyone can wear the mask. You could wear the mask. If you didn't know that before, I hope you do now.",
      "I don't want to talk about the things we've gone through. Though it's hurting me, now it's history. I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too. Nothing more to say, no more ace to play.",
      "Mother used to say that however miserable one is, there's always something to be thankful for. And each morning, when the sky brightened and light began to flood my cell, I agreed with her.",
      "If you are not willing to learn, no one can help you. If you are determined to learn, no one can stop you.",
      "I do not deny that what happened to us is a thing worth laughing at. But it is not worth telling, for not everyone is sufficiently intelligent to be able to see things from the right point of view.",
      "Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you. By now you should've somehow realized what you gotta do. I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now.",
      "A hero can be anyone. Even a man doing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a young boy's shoulders to let him know that the world hadn't ended.",
      "He who knows only his own side of the case, knows little of that. His reasons may be good, and no one may have been able to refute them. But if he is equally unable to refute the reasons on the opposite side; if he does not so much as know what they are, he has no ground for preferring either opinion.",
      "He spent six hours examining things, trying to find a difference from their appearance on the previous day in the hope of discovering in them some change that would reveal the passage of time.",

      "There must be quite a few things a hot bath won't cure, but I don't know many of them.",

      "What really knocks me out is a book that, when you're all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it. That doesn't happen much, though.",
      "Why are you the way that you are? Honestly, every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not... that way. I hate so much about the things that you choose to be.",
      "I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean. Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens. Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance when you get the choice to sit it out or dance.",
      "If you want a happy ending, that depends, of course, on where you stop your story.",
      "Whenever there is a meeting, a parting shall follow. But that parting needs not last forever. Whether a parting be forever or merely for a short while... that is up to you.",
      "As if that blind rage had washed me clean, rid me of hope; for the first time, in that night alive with signs and stars, I opened myself to the gentle indifference of the world. Finding it so much like myself, I felt that I had been happy and that I was happy again.",

      "There are but two types of men who desire war: those who haven't the slightest intention of fighting it themselves, and those who haven't the slightest idea what it is. Any man who has seen the face of death knows better than to seek him out a second time.",

      "A great teacher has little external history to record. His life goes over into other lives. These men are pillars in the intimate structure of our schools. They are more essential than its stones or beams and they will continue to be a kindling force and a revealing power in our lives.",
      "Human beings do not live forever, Reuven. We live less than the time it takes to blink an eye, if we measure our lives against eternity. So it may be asked what value is there to a human life. There is so much pain in the world. What does it mean to have to suffer so much if our lives are nothing more than the blink of an eye?",
      "Tonight I'll dream while in my bed. When silly thoughts go through my head, about the bugs and alphabet, and when I wake tomorrow I'll bet that you and I will walk together again. I can tell that we are going to be friends.",
      "Can you live without answers? All of you, ask that of yourself. Can you live without answers? Because if you cannot, then most assuredly you will invent your own answers and they will comfort you. And all those who do not share your view will by their very existence strike fear and hatred into your heart.",
      "You must follow me carefully. I shall have to controvert one or two ideas that are almost universally accepted. The geometry, for instance, they taught you at school is founded on a misconception.",
      "I don't know what it is about you, but I feel like myself when I'm with you, but the way I always wanted to feel, because I'm in love with you Megan, and I think I have been for a while.",

      "I'll find you in the morning sun and when the night is new. I'll be looking at the moon, but I'll be seeing you. I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day, in everything that's light and gay. I'll always think of you that way.",
      "Green is the sound the wind makes, rustling through the trees. If we walked down to the riverbank and you put your hand in the water, you'd feel the cool color blue. To remember red, you need only stand in front of the hearth. And a winter snowfall, silent and cold and pure... that is white.",
      "If everyone keeps asking you the same questions, maybe you have to come up with new answers just to stay awake.",
      "A glooming peace this morning with it brings. The sun for sorrow will not show its head. Go hence to have more talk of these sad things. Some shall be pardoned and some punished. For never was a story of more woe than this of Juliet and her Romeo.",
      "All we need for morality is contained in these words: make others happy as you yourself would be, and serve them in the way you would yourself be served. The sole requirement is a good heart.",
      "There are some fights you just can't win. A force can be so overwhelming that no tactical approach in a fight is going to lead to a victory worth having. When you can't win in a fight, sometimes you have to settle for making sure that if you lose, everyone loses. It works for nuclear weapons, it works for me.",
      "I just feel like there are so many things that I could be doing and probably want to be doing that I'm just not.",
      "Any one can get angry - that is easy - or give or spend money; but to do this to the right person, to the right extent, at the right time, with the right motive, and in the right way, that is not for everyone, nor is it easy; wherefore goodness is both rare and laudable and noble.",

      "It's you that perceives reality as bad and unpleasant. It's you who's mistaken reality for the truth. Your perspective on reality and the importance you place on reality, the slightest difference in these things will greatly change the world inside your mind.",
      "I see a line of cars and they're all painted black with flowers and my love, both never to come back. I see people turn their heads and quickly look away. Like a new born baby, it just happens every day.",
      "But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time. Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time. I got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined. I checked it once, then I checked it twice.",
      "Society is commonly too cheap. We meet at very short intervals, not having had time to acquire any new value for each other. We meet at meals three times a day, and give each other a new taste of that old musty cheese that we are.",
      "You may tell a tale that takes up residence in someone's soul, becomes their blood and self and purpose. That tale will move them and drive them and who knows what they might do because of it, because of your words. That is your role, your gift.",
      "Middle management means that you got just enough responsibility to listen when people talk, but not so much you can't tell anybody to go screw themselves.",
      "And though it's always been with me, I must tear down the wall and let it be. All I am, and all that I was ever meant to be, in harmony, shining true and smiling back at all who wait to cross. There is no loss.",
      "If I ruled the world every day would be the first day of spring, every heart would have a new song to sing, and we'd sing of the joy every morning would bring. If I ruled the world every man would be as free as a bird, every voice would be a voice to be heard. Take my word, we would treasure each day that occurred.",
      "I feel it in my fingers, I feel it in my toes. Love is all around me and so the feeling grows. It's written on the wind, it's everywhere I go. So if you really love me, come on and let it show.",
      "The pie maker considered how not telling Chuck the truth about her father was a lot like being locked in a prison. Then he considered how being locked in a prison was actually much worse than some silly metaphor about truth.",
      "I used to think that memories were a way of holding on to the truth, never forgetting what really happened. But it turns out, memories are more like dreams. They tell us everything about ourselves, whether we're ready for it, or not.",
      "After snow comes up, the wind blows it around so it looks like it's coming down but actually it comes up out of the ground - like grass. It comes up, Charlie Brown, snow comes up!",
      "The less you do with the controls, the less chance of error. Steer, shift, and use the pedals smoothly, and with finesse - not with blinding speed and brute force. The slower you move, the faster the car moves.",
      "They're talking about things of which they don't have the slightest understanding, anyway. It's only because of their stupidity that they're able to be so sure of themselves.",
      "The main thing to do is pay attention. Pay close attention to everything, notice what no one else notices. Then you'll know what no one else knows, and that's always useful.",
      "The rain fell slow, down on all the roofs of uncertainty. I thought of you, and the years and all the sadness fell away from me. And did you know... I never thought that you'd lose the light in your eyes?",
      "Even in the darkest times and places there were always good people. People who would help others out of the kindness of their hearts.",
      "This combinatory play seems to be the essential feature in productive thought - before there is any connection with logical construction in words or other kinds of signs which can be communicated to others.",
      "Every time I hear that dear old wedding march, I feel rather glad I have a broken arch. I have heard a lot of married people talk, and I know that marriage is a long, long walk. To most people weddings mean romance, but I prefer a picnic or a dance.",
      "You have technicians here making noise. No one is a musician, they are not artists because nobody can play the guitar.",
      "People go missing around here, they're gone for good. Outsiders come, they don't know where to walk. They bring trouble. We just want to be left alone. And so does he.",
      "The distinguishing mark of man is the hand, the instrument with which he does all his mischief.",
      "Tell me again, was it love at first sight when I walked by and you caught my eye? Didn't you know love could shine this bright? Well, smile because you're the deer in the headlights.",
      "All I do is talk a big game, and make myself sound like a big shot, when I can't do anything! I never do anything, yet I complain like a pro. Who do you think I am? It's amazing that I can live like this and not feel ashamed!",
      "I think you're still trying to figure out where you are. Where that ship of yours is. How to get back to that life.",
      "I never did like the idea of sitting on newspapers. I did it once, and all the headlines came off on my white pants. On the level! It actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They just followed me around over town and read the news on the seat of my pants.",
      "The dispositions of agents, their habitus, that is, the mental structures through which they apprehend the social world, are essentially the product of the internalization of the structures of that world.",
      "And men go abroad to admire the heights of mountains, the mighty billows of the sea, the broad tides of rivers, the compass of the ocean, and the circuits of the stars, and pass themselves by.",
      "The gentleman helps others to realize what is good in them; he does not help them to realize what is bad in them. The small man does the opposite.",
      "You're like the sun and I am Earth - together we're one. But someday your fire will die and I'll grow cold without sunlight.",
      "The pleasure of rooting for Goliath is that you can expect to win. The pleasure of rooting for David is that, while you don't know what to expect, you stand at least a chance of being inspired.",
      "Come on now, we're going to go build a mirror factory first and put out nothing but mirrors for the next year and take a long look in them.",
      "You are older than me. Do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal? Your eyes have died but you see more than I. Daniel, you're a star in the face of the sky.",
      "Kinda cold, walking home. Growing older on my own. Feels so strange to say when I am not alone. Faith will claim to be a friend to those she own but she will never try to call when I'm by the phone.",
      "I wish that strife would vanish away from among gods and mortals, and gall, which makes a man grow angry for all his great mind, that gall of anger that swarms like smoke inside of a man's heart and becomes a thing sweeter to him by far than the dripping of honey.",
      "I've seen it all. I have seen the trees, I have seen the willow leaves dancing in the breeze, I've seen a man killed by his best friend and lives that were over before they were spent. I've seen what I was and I know what I'll be. I've seen it all, there is no more to see.",
      "One thing I've learned in the last seven years: in every game and con there's always an opponent, and there's always a victim. The trick is to know when you're the latter, so you can become the former.",
      "You've got a way to keep me on your side. You give me cause for love that I can't hide. For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide. Because you're mine, I walk the line.",
      "Formerly, when I would feel a desire to understand someone, or myself, I would take into consideration not actions, in which everything is relative, but wishes. Tell me what you want and I'll tell you who you are.",

      "What's cool about really little kids is that they don't say stuff to try to hurt your feelings, even though sometimes they do say stuff that hurts your feelings. But they don't actually know what they're saying. Big kids, though: they know what they're saying. And that is definitely not fun for me.",
      "Every breath you take and every move you make, every bond you break, every step you take, I'll be watching you. Every single day and every word you say, every game you play, every night you say, I'll be watching you.",
      "The pleasure of remembering had been taken from me, because there was no longer anyone to remember with. It felt like losing your co-rememberer meant losing the memory itself, as if the things we'd done were less real and important than they had been hours before.",
      "Once there were two moons in the sky, but one wandered too close to the sun and cracked from the heat. A thousand thousand dragons poured forth, and drank the fire of the sun. That is why dragons breathe flame. One day the other moon will kiss the sun too, and then it will crack and the dragons will return.",
      "What would you do if you were stuck in one place and every day was exactly the same and nothing that you did mattered?",
      "Reach out for me and hold me tight. Hold that memory. Let my machine talk to me, let my machine talk to me. This is my world and I am world leader pretend. This is my life and this is my time. I have been given the freedom to do as I see fit. It's high time I've raised the walls that I've constructed.",
      "Kazi tells me stories about you once in a while. I hardly ask him to tell me about you, though, because I'm afraid that the stories might run out. I want to save them, like a treat.",
      "Seriously though, in this day and age I don't know why we're still cutting open frogs to see what's inside them. If somebody tells me there's a heart and intestines inside a frog, I'm willing to take their word for it.",
      "You've faced horrors in these past weeks... I don't know which is worse. The terror you feel the first time you witness such things, or the numbness that comes after it starts to become ordinary.",
      "I can tell you my love for you will still be strong, after the boys of summer have gone.",
      "But the two men were not lonely at all. At home they were content to eat and drink, and Singer would talk with his hands eagerly to his friend about all that was in his mind. So the years passed in this quiet way until Singer reached the age of thirty-two.",
      "What do you do with the mad that you feel, when you feel so mad you could bite? When the whole wide world seems oh so wrong and nothing you do seems very right? What do you do? Do you punch a bag, do you pound some clay or some dough? Do you round up friends for a game of tag and see how fast you go?",
      "But I try not to think with my gut. If I'm serious about understanding the world, thinking with anything besides my brain, as tempting as that might be, is likely to get me into trouble.",
      "The stuff we call \"software\" is not like anything that human society is used to thinking about. Software is something like a machine, and something like mathematics, and something like language, and something like thought, and art, and information... But software is not in fact any of those other things.",
      "At the doorway on my heart all the leaves are falling down, and though I try to pick them up there's so many I think I'll drown. Ten days have come and gone, ten days and I'm all alone, and all that I can do is pray and pray.",
      "All this running around. I can't fight it much longer. Something's trying to get out. And it's never been closer. If my take off fails, make up some other story. But if I never come back, tell my mother I'm sorry.",
      "It is as hard to understand how consciousness emerges and dies as it is to comprehend how something, the stuff of the universe, erupted out of nothing. Was there a creation or was there always something? Could there even be nothing if there were no one to know there was nothing?",
      "If I were to take even one step back right now, I get the feeling that I'd never be able to return back to where I'm standing right now.",
      "That's right, and the one who wins gets a prize, only there really isn't a prize. It's just the honor of winning, because all the money goes to charity, that is, if there is any money left over, but there never is.",
      "I get to thinking of all the things you said. You gave a promise to me, and I gave mine to you. I need someone beside me in everything I do.",
      "You're born alone and you die alone, and this world just drops a bunch of rules on top of you to make you forget those facts. But I never forget. I'm living like there's no tomorrow, 'cause there isn't one.",
      "You can know the name of a bird in all the languages of the world, but when you're finished, you'll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird. So let's look at the bird and see what it's doing - that's what counts. I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.",
      "See, that's the kind of thing I'm hoping to avoid. So when my little girl comes down the stairs, you're gonna say how nice it was to meet me, then you're gonna go drop her off at school and you're gonna say goodbye.",
      "Wendy, let me explain something to you. Whenever you come in here and interrupt me, you're breaking my concentration. You're distracting me. And it will then take me time to get back to where I was. You understand?",
      "Things conceived by minds and made by hands can never be quite the same, even if they try their best to be identical, because they're never the same from day to day or even moment to moment.",
      "It's been a hard day's night, and I'd been working like a dog. It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log. But when I get home to you I find the things that you do will make me feel alright.",
      "Though I never knew you at all, you had the grace to hold yourself while those around you crawled. They crawled out of the woodwork and they whispered into your brain. They set you on the treadmill and they made you change your name.",
      "There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold and she's buying a stairway to heaven. When she gets there she knows if the stores are all closed with a word she can get what she came for.",
      "For as long as a single man is forced to cower under the iron fist of oppression, as long as a child cries out in the night, or an actor can be elected president, we must continue the struggle.",
      "On the day that you were born the angels got together and decided to create a dream come true. So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold and starlight in your eyes of blue.",
      "Kelsey, in this terrifying world, all we have are the connections that we make. I'm sorry I got you fired.",
      "There are very few things I wish I could change about those two decades, but there are many things I wish I had known. I wish I had known, for instance, that such a long period of being single was in the cards for me. I also wish I'd known earlier that such a delay was not abnormal among my generation.",
      "And the mind that has conceived a plan of living must never lose sight of the chaos against which that pattern was conceived. That goes for societies as well as for individuals.",
      "The life of everyone on board depends upon just one thing: finding someone back there who can not only fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner.",
      "I believe a man lost in the mazes of his own mind may imagine that he's anything.",
      "The heaviest penalty for declining to rule is to be ruled by someone inferior to yourself.",
      "Step out the front door like a ghost into the fog where no one notices the contrast of white on white. And in between the moon and you the angels get a better view of the crumbling difference between wrong and right. I walk in the air between the rain through myself and back again. Where? I don't know.",
      "It just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Mostly dead is slightly alive. With all dead, well, with all dead there's usually only one thing you can do. Go through his clothes and look for loose change.",
      "It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife.",
      "Turn me loose from your hands, let me fly to distant lands over green fields, trees and mountains, flowers and forest fountains. Home along the lanes of the skyway.",
      "Now wait a minute. Just a minute. There's only one thing you need in life to make you happy, and that is friends. That's all you need is friends, and then you'll be happy. So if you have friends, you'll be a happy person. You also need food and clothes.",
      "'Cause I don't care too much for money, money can't buy me love.",
      "Do you know what an artist and a sniper have in common? Details. Like when a touch of color is out of place. When a shadow does not match with its surroundings. Or when a shape is not where it is supposed to be. The only difference is the stakes. Mine are higher.",
      "When we are young, wandering the face of the earth, wondering what our dreams might be worth, learning that we're only immortal for a limited time - we travel on the road to adventure, on a desert highway straight to the heart of the sun. Like lovers and heroes, and the restless part of everyone - we're only at home when we're on the run.",
      "I could kill you. Snap my fingers, easiest thing in the world. From here on, I want you to know that the only reason you're alive is because I allowed it.",
      "That's it. We have always done things your way. I have bent over backwards to make you happy. I bought the ring you wanted. The china you wanted. The crystal you wanted. I even agreed to have a duvet cover on my bed. I don't know what a duvet is or what it's supposed to cover. When are we going to do something that I want to do?",
      "Looking back, I saw that for my whole conscious life I had not understood either myself or my strivings. What had seemed for so long to be beneficial now turned out in actuality to be fatal, and I had been striving to go in the opposite direction to that which was truly necessary to me.",
      "It is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it. Those who, like you, have leadership thrust upon them, and take up the mantle because they must, and find to their own surprise that they wear it well.",
      "I already am eating from the trash can all the time. The name of this trash can is ideology. The material force of ideology makes me not see what I am effectively eating.",
      "Life is not suffering; it's just that you will suffer it, rather than enjoy it, until you let go of your mind's attachments and just go for the ride freely, no matter what happens.",
      "Clear the lines of lint in your head one at a time and the king will be left standing alone like a guy on a street corner. Here, I'll make it easier for you.",
      "I walk a lonely road, the only one that I have ever known. Don't know where it goes, but it's only me and I walk alone. I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams. Where the city sleeps, and I'm the only one and I walk alone.",
      "There's enough to pass around, you don't gotta wait in line. And the clocks don't work, you don't gotta check the time. And the blinds don't work, you don't gotta check the sky. We be going all night, 'til light.",
      "I have no idea to this day what those two Italian ladies were singing about. Truth is, I don't want to know. Some things are best left unsaid. I'd like to think they were singing about something so beautiful, it can't be expressed in words, and makes your heart ache because of it.",
      "You'll face lots of pain and despair on the way. In fact, the very road we walk is paved with tragedy. But we are the ones who chose to walk it. We'll take on the dirty work and bring about a new world. And once it's all over, we can disappear.",
      "When I close my eyes, I am at the center of the sun. And I cannot be hurt by anything this wicked world has done.",
      "Life without change might be called anything except life, it's nothing more than experience. Yes, Emperor Charles sought the past, you seek the present, but I seek the future.",
      "When you go into the ER, one of the first things they ask you to do is rate your pain on a scale of one to ten.",
      "You know, you are a classic example of the inverse ratio between the size of the mouth and the size of the brain!",
      "What's morality? It's the difference between what is right and what you can rationalize.",
      "May your coming year be filled with magic and dreams and good madness. I hope you read some fine books and kiss someone who thinks you're wonderful, and don't forget to make some art - write or draw or build or sing or live as only you can. And I hope, somewhere in the next year, you surprise yourself.",
      "If any man is able to convince me and show me that I do not think or act right, I will gladly change; for I seek the truth by which no man was ever injured. But he is injured who abides in his error and ignorance.",
      "It's a sad communication with little reason to believe when one isn't giving and one pretends to receive. Pardon my heart if I showed that I cared, but I love you more than moments we have or have not shared.",
      "I have not much hope that Gollum can be cured before he dies, but there is a chance of it. And he is bound up with the fate of the Ring. My heart tells me that he has some part to play yet, for good or ill, before the end; and when that comes, the pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many - yours not least.",
      "It's where the water flows, it's where the wind blows.",
      "There is nothing more admirable than when two people who see eye to eye keep house as man and wife, confounding their enemies and delighting their friends.",
      "Men always believe that. With a law degree you're taking on insurance. After that you can do anything you want. You can work for me.",
      "In this world, evil can arise from the best intentions. And there is good which can come from evil intentions.",
      "It became very clear to me sitting out there today that every decision I've made in my entire life has been wrong. My life is the complete opposite of everything I want it to be. Every instinct I have in every aspect of life, be it something to wear, something to eat - it's all been wrong.",
      "If the time of death is written within 40 seconds after writing the cause of death as a heart attack, the time of death can be manipulated, and the time can go into effect within 40 seconds after writing the name.",
      "In order to return the power to repel evil to your sword, you must find another to take my stead in this temple and ask the gods for their assistance. You must find the one who carries on my bloodline... The one who holds this sacred instrument.",
      "But you'd have to walk a thousand miles in my shoes, just to see what it's like to be me. I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to feel your pain, you feel mine. Go inside each other's minds, just to see what we find, look at stuff through each other's eyes.",
      "Some people say that bowling alleys got big lanes. Some people say that bowling alleys all look the same. There's not a line that goes here that rhymes with anything. Had a dream last night but I forget what it was.",
      "Well, gentlemen, the way I see it, if this hot weather continues, it's going to melt the polar caps and the whole wide world. And all the parts that ain't water already will surely be flooded.",
      "I feel that way all the time. Like I'm from some other planet, you know? Like my soul was stuffed into the wrong body and then dropped off here by mistake.",
      "And you know it's time to go, through the sleet and driving snow, across the fields of mourning, light in the distance. And you hunger for the time - time to heal, desire time, and your earth moves beneath your own dream landscape.",
      "There is no real going back. Though I may come to the Shire, it will not seem the same; for I shall not be the same. I am wounded with knife, sting, and tooth, and a long burden. Where shall I find rest?",
      "Open up your heart to me now. Let it all come pouring out. There's nothing I can't take. If it's love just feel it. And if this life will see it. This is no time to be alone, alone yeah. I won't let you go.",
      "It was a marvelous night, the sort of night one only experiences when one is young. The sky was so bright, and there were so many stars that, gazing upward, one could not help wondering how so many whimsical wicked people could live under such a sky.",
      "The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice. And someone way down here loses someone dear. The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall. It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain?",
      "Your bill is ready. You take it over there and you introduce it. You get to your feet in the Senate and take a long breath and start spouting. But not too loud because a couple of the senators might want to sleep.",
      "So it's all come back round to breaking apart again. Breaking apart like I'm made up of glass again. Making it up behind my back again. Holding my breath for the fear of sleep again. Holding it up behind my head again. Cut in deep to the heart of the bone again. Round and round and round and it's coming apart again. Over and over and over.",
      "We have all got to exert ourselves a little to keep sane, and call things by the same names as other people call them by.",
      "I heard some kids telling me, how they've lost faith in the way. They've been talking world peace, and the wars in the streets. The lines on their faces so deep. A revolution or reach out and touch the day. We're overdue child.",
      "Try to understand men, if you understand each other you will be kind to each other. Knowing a man well never leads to hate and nearly always leads to love.",
      "Joy to hearts which have suffered long is like the dew on the ground after a long drought; both the heart and the ground absorb that beneficent moisture falling on them, and nothing is outwardly apparent.",
      "If you worship money and things, if they are where you tap real meaning in life, then you will never have enough, never feel you have enough. It's the truth. Worship your body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly. And when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally grieve you.",
      "And it says to you love when you can, cry when you have to, be who you must. That's a part of the plan. Await your arrival with simple survival and one day we'll all understand.",
      "I can see you. Your brown skin shining in the sun. You got that top pulled down and your sunglasses on, baby. And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong, after the boys of summer have gone.",
      "If you want to hang on my shoulder, I'm standing here. If you want to do it all over, let me get near. If you were another pretender, oh I'd pass you by. If you were a lost weekender, oh maybe I'd try. When you gonna give me something to grab for?",
      "Words have the power to both destroy and heal. When words are both true and kind, they can change our world.",
      "Every second he breathed, the smell of the grass, the cool air on his face, was so precious: To think that people had years and years, time to waste, so much time it dragged, and he was clinging to each second.",
      "All we really want is for no one to have a boring life, to be impressive, so we can be impressed.",
      "The painter will produce pictures of little merit if he takes the works of others as his standard; but if he will apply himself to learn from the objects of nature he will produce good results.",
      "Sitting in the morning sun, I'll be sitting when the evening comes. Watching the ships roll in, and I watch them roll away again. Sitting on the dock of the bay, watching the tide roll away. I'm just sitting on the dock of the bay wasting time.",
      "We all have life storms, and when we get the rough times and we recover from them, we should celebrate that we got through it. No matter how bad it may seem, there's always something beautiful that you can find.",
      "Living in the limelight, the universal dream for those who wish to seem. Those who wish to be must put aside the alienation, get on with the fascination, the real relation, the underlying theme.",
      "Imagine you're stood on a beach, water gently lapping at your feet. But now you're sinking, what were you thinking? That's all the time we have this week.",
      "There is no way that this winter is ever going to end as long as this groundhog keeps seeing his shadow. I don't see any other way out. He's got to be stopped. And I have to stop him.",
      "I wondered how they would've felt if every time their husband went in to make a deal, there was a one in four chance he wouldn't come out of that meeting.",
      "Well, let me tell you something, Caveman. You are here on account of one person. If it wasn't for that person, you wouldn't be here digging holes in the hot sun. You know who that person is?",
      "Gately can't even imagine what it would be like to be a sober and drug-free biker. It's like what would be the point. He imagines these people polishing the hell out of their leather and like playing a lot of really precise pool.",
      "There are books of which the backs and covers are by far the best parts.",
      "Even if there's only one actual truth, you can have two truths from two different perspectives. A method to determine which truth is true doesn't actually exist. There's no real method of proving your truth in this world. But believing that you're wrong for that reason is also wrong.",
      "I have quit three jobs and been fired from all the rest. Getting fired, despite sometimes coming as a surprise and leaving you scrambling to recover, is often a godsend: someone else makes the decision for you, and it's impossible to sit in the wrong job for the rest of your life.",
      "No matter how bad things are, you can always make things worse. At the same time, it is often within your power to make them better. I learned this lesson well on New Year's Eve, 2001.",

      "Power isn't control at all - power is strength, and giving that strength to others. A leader isn't someone who forces others to make him stronger; a leader is someone willing to give his strength to others so that they may have the strength to stand on their own.",
      "Remembering you running soft through the night. You were bigger and brighter and whiter than snow. And screamed at the make-believe, screamed at the sky, and you finally found all your courage to let it all go.",

      "I do not see it. It is interesting that people try to find meaningful patterns in things that are essentially random. I have noticed that the images they perceive sometimes suggest what they are thinking about at that particular moment. Besides, it is clearly a bunny rabbit.",
      "Expect the unexpected, they say, but once the unexpected happens, the last thing you expect is that it will happen again.",
      "Talk to me baby. Tell me what you're feeling. You say you don't need to go... don't you pretend you didn't know... how all of this would end up. Girl I saw it in your eyes, and baby I can read your mind, and expectations were not in sight.",
      "There's a sort of evil out there. Something very, very strange in these old woods. Call it what you want. A darkness, a presence. It takes many forms but it's been out there for as long as anyone can remember and we've always been here to fight it.",
      "Do you understand the expense people went through to keep you locked up in that tower? You think people like that are just gonna let you walk away? You are an investment and you will not be safe until you are far away from here.",
      "It's easy to get wrapped up in sharing everyday life with a partner. It's fun to get lost in love and romance. It's the best. But holding on to yourself while doing that is the most important thing.",

      "How much longer is this going to go on, do you think? Do you have an estimate? Are you sure you shouldn't just quit right now? Seriously, think about it. I can tell you're just going to get more sentimental from here on out. There's still time, you know. Are you sure we shouldn't just turn around and take you back to your island?",
      "I don't ever want to feel like I did that day. Take me to the place I love, take me all the way.",
      "Whether they use the title or not, many lyrics have evocative first lines that grab the listener's attention. Often thinking of a good first line can make the rest of the lyric flow.",
      "Surely death has found me, it has kept a hold of me all this far. My actions will reveal, only time will tell. These passions start to slip away, memories flash like seconds in a day.",
      "How can you see into my eyes like open doors leading you down into my core where I've become so numb without a soul. My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold until you find it there and lead it back home.",

      "You better lose yourself in the music, the moment. You own it, you better never let it go. You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow. This opportunity comes once in a lifetime.",
      "I think a nerd is a person who uses the telephone to talk to other people about telephones. And a computer nerd therefore is somebody who uses a computer in order to use a computer.",
      "Still, there are times I am bewildered by each mile I have traveled, each meal I have eaten, each person I have known, each room in which I have slept. As ordinary as it all appears, there are times when it is beyond my imagination.",
      "All right I think we've been down here in the dark long enough. There's a whole other world upstairs. Take my hand, Constant Reader, and I'll be happy to lead you back into the sunshine.

      "The more you see the less you know, the less you find out as you go. I knew much more then, than I do now.",
      "No. Because there are people out there who buy things, people like you and me. And something happened, something terrible, and the way that they saw themselves is gone. And nobody understands that. But you do. And that's very valuable.",
      "I was starting to think that you were gonna leave me behind.",

I think we can win. I think you can win. Earth is our home now. Isn't it worth fighting for?",
      "Listen carefully, my friend. You are stuck in a paradox. It turns out there are three things you cannot do in virtual reality. You cannot die, you cannot get grounded, and you cannot call customer service. This is why you are having problems.",
      "Have you ever felt so strong that it made you feel weak? Long days, long nights, and you just can't sleep. Have you ever been so sure, that it gave you cold feet?

      "You're the one that told me I could swing by any evening, and so I stayed. I figured I'd be heading out the door over the weekend, but I could be swayed. In our own little shack, I like the ring of that.",
      "You know that I am called the Count because I really love to count. Sometimes I sit and count all day, but sometimes I get carried away. I count the spiders on the wall. I count the cobwebs in the hall. I count the candles on the shelf. When I'm alone, I count myself!",
      "And I need it more than love, and I love it more than life, and I want those stars above to shine this night.",
      "No, that is what I'm trying to tell you. He is still a child. He's a normal child. He's made some mistakes - God knows he's got a load to learn about life.

      "I know nobody knows, where it comes and where it goes. I know it's everybody's sin, you got to lose to know how to win.",
      "Selling short is a way to make money if stock prices fall. It involves selling stock you do not currently own in the expectation of buying it back later at a lower price. It's hoping to buy low and sell high, but in reverse order.",
      "I used to think she was quite intelligent, in my stupidity. The reason I did was because she knew quite a lot about the theater and plays and literature and all that stuff.

      "When the snow is on our mind, rows and rows and lines and lines. In the haze of your fixation, we all crave for you, we all crave. And you can kill the wildest thing, but when you murder it's a sin. In the midst of your conviction, we all crave for you, we all crave.",

      "I can fly like an eagle and strike like a hawk.",
      "He was close, real close. I couldn't see him yet, but I could feel him, as if the boat were being sucked upriver and the water was flowing back into the jungle. Whatever was going to happen, it wasn't gonna be the way they call it back in Nha Trang.",
      "I tried to save the Shire, and it has been saved, but not for me. It must often be so, Sam, when things are in danger: some one has to give them up, lose them, so that others may keep them. But you are my heir: all that I had and might have had I leave to you.",
      "Before he leaves the camp he stops. He scans the world outside and where there used to be some shops is where the snipers sometimes hide. He left his home the week before. He thought he'd be like the police but now he finds he is at war. Weren't we supposed to keep the peace?",
      "Someday, I hope to make it clear to you that success is not determined by leather-bound books and ink on paper, but rather the passion that I have found out of heartbreak and anger.

      "Charge 'em for the lice, extra for the mice, two percent for looking in the mirror twice. Here a little slice, there a little cut, three percent for sleeping with the window shut. When it comes to fixing prices, there are a lot of tricks he knows.",
      "Above all, don't lie to yourself. The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to a point that he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around him, and so loses all respect for himself and for others. And having no respect he ceases to love.",

      "We turn away to face the cold, enduring chill, as the day begs the night for mercy love. The sun so bright it leaves no shadows, only scars, carved into stone on the face of earth. The moon is up and over One Tree Hill. We see the sun go down in your eyes.",

      "Don't say you lose just yet, get up and move ahead, and not only for yourself. 'Cause that's your role, the work that stirred your soul you can make for someone else.

      "Rise and shine, Mister Freeman. Rise and shine. Not that I wish to imply you have been sleeping on the job. No one is more deserving of a rest, and all the effort in the world would have gone to waste until... well, let's just say your hour has come again.",

      "Allow me to tell you about some complex feelings. Feelings like the joy of finding another pasta lover. The admiration for another's puzzle-solving skills. The desire to have a cool, smart person think you are cool. These feelings... They must be what you are feeling right now! I can hardly imagine what it must be like to feel that way.",
      "And I don't believe in the existence of angels but looking at you I wonder if that's true. But if I did I would summon them together, and ask them to watch over you.

      "I search the faces of the gods... for ways to please you, to make you proud. One kind word, one full hug... where you pressed me to your chest and held me tight. Would have been like the sun on my heart for a thousand years. What is it in me that you hate so much?",
      "It's the questions we can't answer that teach us the most. They teach us how to think. If you give a man an answer, all he gains is a little fact. But give him a question and he'll look for his own answers.",

      "If you're working out in front of a mirror and watching your muscles grow, your ego has reached a point where it is now eating itself. That's why I believe there should be a psychiatrist at every health club, so that when they see you doing this, they will take you away for a little chat.",

      "I want to defeat the me that's dragging this failure around. I don't want to forget my failure. But if I carry it with me as a bad memory and keep running away, I will never change.",
      "Don't your feet get cold in the winter time? The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine. It's hard to tell the night time from the day. You're losing all your highs and lows; ain't it funny how the feeling goes away?",

      "When I was a young man, I had liberty, but I did not see it. I had time, but I did not know it. And I had love, but I did not feel it. Many decades would pass before I understood the meaning of all three. And now, the twilight of my life, this understanding has passed into contentment.",
      "I hate this place, this zoo, this prison, this reality, whatever you want to call it. I can't stand it any longer. It's the smell, if there is such a thing. I feel saturated by it. I can taste your stink, and every time I do, I fear that I've somehow been infected by it.",
      "You've got me over the moon, and that's no jest. We're miles above the rest. Look in your eyes and I know we'll be fine. So let's shoot for the stars and make this love really shine.",
      "A brother who lives at home and is still considered more successful than I am, which could be because I live in a trailer that, while it may look like Jeannie's bottle, is actually slightly smaller.",
      "In the mornings, when I'm usually wide awake, I love to take a walk through the gardens and down by the lake, where I often see a duck and a drake, and I wonder, as I walk by, just what they'd say if they could speak, although I know that's an absurd thought.",
      "The truth is that there are a lot of people like you, us, with strange hobbies or talents or gifts and we try to hide it because we're afraid that it makes us seem weird or it will turn people off, but that's a mistake. What makes me unique has brought every person I love into my life.",
      "I would've told her that Davis and I never talked much, or even looked at each other, but it didn't matter, because we were looking at the same sky together, which is maybe more intimate than eye contact anyway. Anybody can look at you. It's quite rare to find someone who sees the same world you see.",
      "Power is a lot like real estate. It's all about location, location, location. The closer you are to the source, the higher your property value.",
      "The essential and defining characteristic of childhood is not the effortless merging of dream and reality, but only alienation. There are no words for childhood's dark turns and exhalations. A wise child recognizes it and submits to the necessary consequences. A child who counts the cost is a child no longer.",
      "Sometimes when he brushed, he felt like he was scrubbing at the very crust of his soul.",
      "Each day I sat on the verandah with my uncle and cousins looking toward the city. We had stopped listening to the storytelling cassette, as curfews started before dark. My uncle laughed less and less, and sighed more and more. We continued to hope that things would change, but they kept getting worse.",
      "I wanna be inside your heaven. Take me to the place you cry from, where the storm blows your way. I wanna be earth that holds you. Every bit of air you're breathing in, a soothing wind, I wanna be inside your heaven.",
      "I see trees of green, red roses too, I see them bloom for me and you, and I think to myself what a wonderful world. I see skies of blue and clouds of white, the bright blessed day, the dark sacred night, and I think to myself what a wonderful world.",
      "I became a yearbook photographer because I liked the idea that I could sort of watch life without having to be part of it. But when you're yearbook photographer, you're like never in the picture.",
      "I know you feel where I'm coming from, regardless of the things in my past that I've done. Most of it really was for the hell of the fun, on the carousel so around I spun. With no directions just tryna get some. Tryna chase skirts, living in the summer sun. And so I lost more than I had ever won, and honestly, I ended up with none.",
      "I had the brief notion that his heart, pressed flat as a flower, crimson and thin as tissue paper, lay in this file. It was a very thin one.",
      "I know more about the private lives of celebrities than I do about any governmental policy that will actually affect me. I'm interested in things that are none of my business, and I'm bored by things that are important to know.",
      "If you are with the quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain't sleepy - if you are anywheres where it won't do for you to scratch, why you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places.",
      "In his dealings with the world the gentleman is not invariably for or against anything. He is on the side of what is moral.",
      "Our existence on this planet may well depend on the decisions we make and the actions we take. Now is the time to act!",
      "When a free man dies, he loses the pleasure of life. A slave loses his pain. Death is the only freedom a slave knows. That's why he's not afraid of it. That's why we'll win.",
      "I'm going to roll my window up, then I'm going to drive away, and you're gonna go home to your daughter.",
      "Bobby, my uncle loves you. He needs you. So you're gonna get up tomorrow morning and you're gonna get dressed, and you're gonna get in that car and you're gonna do what needs to be done, aren't you?",
      "Most of the people in the industry were young because the guys who had any real experience were too smart to get involved in all these crazy little machines.",
      "We come from two different worlds but there's only one love that could make things easier.",
      "My shadow is always with me. Sometimes ahead, sometimes behind, sometimes to the left, sometimes to the right. Except on cloudy days or at night.",
      "The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far.",
      "I'm happy to put this all behind us and get back to work. After all, we've got a lot to do, and only sixty more years to do it. More or less. I don't have the actuarial tables in front of me.",
      "Half the time she did things not simply, not for themselves; but to make people think this or that; perfect idiocy she knew for no one was ever for a second taken in.",
      "And I wonder if everything could ever feel this real forever, if anything could ever be this good again.",
      "The alternative to binge travel - the mini retirement - entails relocating to one place for one to six months before going home or moving to another locale. Rather than seeking to see the world, we aim to experience it at a speed that lets it change us.",
      "Son, your ego is writing checks your body can't cash.",
      "No fair. You really know how to make me cry when you give me those ocean eyes. I'm scared. I've never fallen from quite this high. Falling into your ocean eyes. Those ocean eyes.",
      "Have you ever fixed a nose before? No, but I've done several toes, and how different are they really?",
      "And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. History became legend. Legend became myth. And for two and a half thousand years, the ring passed out of all knowledge.",
      "What you are, and who you are should provide greater clarity about where you have been and where you are headed. Although one distinguishes spiritual from physical nature, the ultimate unification of the two is the consequence of the struggle for internal, external and eternal - peace.",
      "The day is made up of 24 hours and an infinite number of moments. We need to be aware of those moments and make the most of them regardless of whether we're busy doing something or contemplating life.",
      "How about tellers? You take tellers. They never tell you anything. They always ask questions. And interest, there's nothing interesting about it at all. It's boring. Oh and then the trust department, they got all the pens chained down to the tables. What kind of trust is that?",
      "But he didn't and he never will. We all pay for our choices kid. Maybe your old man fought for you, maybe he did it for himself. The only thing you know for sure is he's gone now. But I'm here. Now, get up. Time to stop taking a beating and start giving one.",
      "She's got a smile that, it seems to me, reminds me of childhood memories, where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky. Now and then when I see her face she takes me away to that special place and if I'd stare too long I'd probably break down and cry.",
      "You might walk when you first enter a world and are unfamiliar with the terrain, but once you gain knowledge of your surroundings, it's easier to run!",
      "I know you have received orders from our commandant, which he has received from his superiors, to dispose of the population of this camp. Now would be the time to do it. Here they are; they're all here. This is your opportunity. Or, you could leave, and return to your families as men instead of murderers.",
      "Okay, listen to me, Judy. I don't mind that you're working with my husband, or that you even bake him those little treats, as you do. But if you're going to start acting like him, you gotta put a mustache on, 'cause you sound ridiculous.",
      "Suffering has been stronger than all other teaching, and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be. I have been bent and broken, but - I hope - into a better shape.",
      "The old man told us to go back to other parts of the yard, but there was no more real work done that afternoon. Stranded in this mill town railroad yard while the whole world was converging elsewhere, we seemed to be nothing but children playing among heroic men.",
      "It's been a long day without you, my friend, and I'll tell you all about it when I see you again. We've come a long way from where we began.",
      "Once in a lifetime there comes a motion picture which changes the whole history of motion pictures. A picture so stunning in its effect, so vast in its impact that it profoundly affects the lives of all who see it.",
      "Call me Ishmael. Some years ago - never mind how long precisely - having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world.",
      "I used to kid her once in a while because she wouldn't take her kings out of the back row.",
      "He pushes people away before they get a chance to leave him. It's a defense mechanism. And for twenty years he's been alone because of that. And if you push him right now, it's gonna be the same thing all over again and I'm not gonna let that happen to him.",
      "But you know that when the truth is told, you can get what you want or you can just get old; you're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through. When will you realize? Vienna waits for you.",
      "One day when I was able to get up, I decided to look at myself in the mirror on the opposite wall. I had not seen myself since the ghetto. From the depths of the mirror, a corpse was contemplating me. The look in his eyes as he gazed at me has never left me.",
      "Grab your coat and get your hat, leave your worry on the doorstep. Just direct your feet to the sunny side of the street. Can't you hear a pitter-pat? And that happy tune is your step. Life can be so sweet on the sunny side of the street.",
      "A melancholy air can never be the right thing; what you want is a bored air. If you are melancholy, it must be because you want something, there is something in which you have not succeeded. It is showing your inferiority. If you are bored, on the other hand, it is the person who has tried in vain to please you who is inferior.",
      "And let's remember that science isn't a game of chess, although chess may be played scientifically. The other thing to remember is that if we are to organize the masses we must first organize ourselves.",
      "We want a good life with a nose for things, the fresh wind and bright sky to endure my suffering. I'm a hole without a key if I break my tongue. Oh, speaking of tomorrow, how will it ever come?",
      "The ultimate way to compose is to be able to keyboard as fast as you can think. This is not easy to do, but your goal should be at least to develop the ability to think of the word and have the appropriate fingers tap the appropriate keys without interrupting the thinking process so your thoughts can flow onto the screen.",
      "I close my eyes only for a moment, and the moment's gone. All my dreams pass before my eyes, a curiosity. Dust in the wind, all they are is dust in the wind.",
      "He heard the sound of waves striking the shore, and it was as though the surging of his young blood was keeping time with the movement of the sea's great tides. It was doubtless because nature itself satisfied his need that Shinji felt no particular lack of music in his everyday life.",
      "You know that death is the most beautiful part of life, right? Death is beautiful because we all fear death. And fear is the most amazing emotion of all because it creates complete awareness. It brings you to now. It makes you truly present. And when we are truly present, it's nirvana. It's pure love. So death is pure love.",
      "You see, I'm moving on fast. Finally got the pass, gonna leave this thing behind. You cut deep, but you don't see, you don't care.",
      "I am learning about twenty new Italian words a day. Where am I getting the brain space to store these words? I'm hoping that maybe my mind has decided to clear out some old negative thoughts and sad memories and replace them with these shiny new words.",
      "Well I woke in mid-afternoon 'cause that's when it all hurts the most. I dream I never know anyone at the party and I'm always the host. If dreams are like movies, then memories are films about ghosts. You can never escape, you can only move south down the coast.",
      "The idea behind each one was we took a film that we like and made the title stupider. And then made a new film to reflect the new stupid title. It's a formula that only produces horrible films, but for some reason we kept using it.",
      "He's been known to obsess over typos in e-mails to the point that he could not see past the errors and read the actual content of the messages. Even in social settings, Musk might get up from the dinner table without a word of explanation to head outside and look at the stars, simply because he's not willing to suffer fools or small talk.",
      "Are you, are you coming to the tree? Where they strung up a man, they say who murdered three. Strange things did happen here, no stranger would it be, if we met at midnight in the hanging tree.",
      "When we're young, we're taught the distinction between a hero and a villain, good and evil, a savior and a lost cause. But what if the only real difference is just who's telling the story?",
      "I don't know what you're talking about. I don't agree with what you're saying. And you're trying to wind me up. But I'm very, very angry, and I want this conversation to stop right away.",
      "So I can't live with you or without you, and don't seem to know my own mind.",
      "Do not meddle in the affairs of wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger.",
      "I think human beings must have faith or must look for faith, otherwise our life is empty. To live and not to know why the cranes fly, why children are born, why there are stars in the sky. You must know why you are alive, or else everything is nonsense, just blowing in the wind.",
      "I must've forgot, you can't trust me. I'm open a moment and closed when you show it. Before you know it, I'm off at sea. And now that I write and think about it, and the story unfolds; you should take my life, you should take my soul.",
      "When we got to the Mint I parked on the street in front of the casino, around a corner from the parking lot. No point risking a scene in the lobby, I thought.",
      "You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack places which are undefended. You can ensure the safety of your defense if you only hold positions that cannot be attacked.",
      "You and I, we've been through a lot together. I look back and I just, uh, I appreciate all the times that... that we had together, you know? I remember just going down in my room and, you know, dealing... tryin' to deal with some things. And you've always been there for that. Always. Just me and you.",
      "All time is all time. It does not change. It does not lend itself to warnings or explanations. It simply is. Take it moment by moment, and you will find that we are all, as I've said before, bugs in amber.",
      "Well, if some people get upset because they feel they have a hold on some things, I'm merely acting as a gentle reminder: here today, gone tomorrow, so don't get attached to things now. With that in mind, I'm not against collecting stuff.",
      "I don't like you, but I love you. Seems that I'm always thinking of you. Oh, you treat me badly, I love you madly, you really got a hold on me. I don't want you, but I need you. Don't want to kiss you, but I need to. Oh, you do me wrong now, my love is strong now, you really got a hold on me.",
      "He looked at her as a man might look at a faded flower he had plucked, in which it was difficult for him to trace the beauty that had made him pick and so destroy it.",
      "The first time I made coffee for just myself, I made too much of it, not being used to being the only person there. And I wandered through the house like a little boy lost at the mall, and an astronaut could've seen the hunger in my eyes from space.",
      "What could there be about a shadow that was so terrible that she knew that there had never been before or ever would be again, anything that would chill her with a fear that was beyond shuddering, beyond crying or screaming, beyond the possibility of comfort?",
      "They got an apartment with deep pile carpet and a couple of paintings from Sears. A big waterbed that they bought with the bread they had saved for a couple of years. They started to fight when the money got tight and they just didn't count on the tears.",
      "Sometimes it seems like we're all living in some kind of prison, and the crime is how much we hate ourselves. It's good to get really dressed up once in a while, and admit the truth - that when you really look closely, people are so strange and so complicated that they're actually beautiful. Possibly even me.",
      "Let's face it: there are tons of things in your home and life that you don't use, need, or even particularly want. Whether you realize it or not, this clutter creates indecision and distractions, consuming attention and making unfettered happiness a real chore.",
      "True, the law isn't perfect. That is because we people who made the law are imperfect. But I still believe the law can show the way to righteousness and justice.",
      "I know I should be angry. I should be furious. What a way to behave your first day at school! But, if you promise me that nothing of the sort will happen again, I won't say another word about it.",
      "He's not asking me to make a choice. He's telling me to take a stand. I'm either with him or against him. All or nothing. I'm disgusted with the whole business. I don't want smicha if the price I have to pay for it is to stop thinking.",
      "I hate this town. It's too filled with memories I'd rather forget. I go to school every day, hang out with my friends, and then go home. There's no place I'd rather not go ever again. I wonder if anything will ever change? Will that day ever come?",
      "When I left my home and my family, I was no more than a boy in the company of strangers in the quiet of the railway station, running scared, laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go. Looking for the places only they would know.",
      "If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now, it's just a spring clean for the May queen. Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run there's still time to change the road you're on.",
      "I've noticed that about your people, Doctor. You find it easier to understand the death of one than the death of a million. You speak about the objective hardness of the Vulcan heart yet how little room there seems to be in yours.",
      "The way you walked was thorny, through no fault of your own, but as the rain enters the soil, the river enters the sea, so tears run to a predestined end. Your suffering is over, Bela my son. Now you will find peace.",
      "We'll send him cheesy movies, the worst we can find. He'll have to sit and watch them all and we'll monitor his mind. Now keep in mind Joel can't control when the movies begin or end because he used those special parts to make his robot friends.",
      "No matter what the world is, the god of that world creates the rules. In truth, you have been defeated by the rules I created. And as punishment for defying the God of the new world, you will die...",
      "If only all the contradictory voices shouting inside my head would calm down and sing a song in unison, whatever it was I wouldn't care as long as they sang without dissonance.",
      "The world is indeed full of peril, and in it there are many dark places; but still there is much that is fair, and though in all lands love is now mingled with grief, it grows perhaps the greater.",
      "Sometimes a hypocrite is nothing more than a man in the process of changing.",
      "You know, back in the apartment, I suddenly felt like I didn't know you at all. It was as if you were a stranger. But how can that be true? I so vividly remember meeting you. I remember falling in love with you. I remember losing you.",
      "I give it to you not that you may remember time, but that you might forget it now and then for a moment and not spend all your breath trying to conquer it. Because no battle is ever won he said. They are not even fought. The field only reveals to man his own folly and despair, and victory is an illusion of philosophers and fools.",
      "We all have too many wheels, screws and valves to judge each other on first impressions or one or two pointers. I don't understand you, you don't understand me and we don't understand ourselves.",
      "Duty bound, Aeneas, though he struggled with desire to calm and comfort her in all her pain, to speak to her and turn her mind from grief, and though he sighed his heart out, shaken still with love of her, yet took the course heaven gave him and turned back to the fleet.",
      "The days go on and on... they don't end. All my life needed was a sense of someplace to go. I don't believe that one should devote his life to morbid self-attention. I believe that one should become a person like other people.",
      "Communication with others takes place when they understand what you're trying to get across to them. If they don't understand, then you are not communicating regardless of words, pictures, or anything else. People only understand things in terms of their experience, which means that you must get within their experience.",
      "Jerry, if you think that by threatening me you can get me to be your slave... Well, that's where you're right. But - and I am only saying this because I care - there are a lot of decaffeinated brands on the market today that are just as tasty as the real thing.",
      "Only the silent, sleepy, staring houses in the backwoods can tell all that has lain hidden since the early days; and they are not communicative, being loath to shake off the drowsiness which helps them forget. Sometimes one feels that it would be merciful to tear down these houses, for they must often dream.",
      "You don't care about anything except you. You just want to persuade people that you love 'em so much that they ought to love you back. Only you want love on your own terms. Something to be played your way, according to your rules.",
      "I want you to know that the day you saw something in me, my whole life changed. And since then, it's been my privilege to not only be at your side, but to be treated like a protege. And for you to be my mentor, and my champion.",
      "You truly love each other and so you might have been truly happy. Not one couple in a century has that chance, no matter what the storybooks say. And so I think no man in a century will suffer as greatly as you will.",
      "We must never forget that human motives are generally far more complicated than we are apt to suppose, and that we can very rarely accurately describe the motives of another.",
      "I gave him my heart, and he took and pinched it to death; and flung it back to me. People feel with their hearts, Ellen, and since he has destroyed mine, I have not power to feel for him.",
      "I don't ask many questions, so it would be fairer if he answered the few I ask. He should be more appreciative. I could be like Amil and ask a question every five seconds, but he doesn't answer many of those either.",
      "Don't change your name, keep it the same for fear I may lose you again. I know you won't, it's just that I'm unorganized and I want to find you when something good happens. If you come down, we'll go to town - I haven't been there for years. But I'd be fine wasting our time not doing anything here.",
      "Hello darkness, my old friend, I've come to talk with you again. Because a vision softly creeping left its seeds while I was sleeping. And the vision that was planted in my brain still remains, within the sound of silence.",
      "We can't retract the decisions we've made. We can only affect the decisions we're going to make from here.",
      "The single most important thing you can do to achieve financial security is to begin a regular savings program and to start it as early as possible.",
      "We all know people who are very bright but who do not always shine when it comes to being logical. They have the ability to think logically - that is, clearly and effectively - but that ability does not habitually manifest itself.",
      "As much money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings would choose above all - the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.",
      "I've never taken you for a killer. A bit intense and unpredictable at times, perhaps emotionally unstable occasionally, but I don't think you're the type of person who could simply walk up to another human being, put a gun to his head, and pull the trigger.",
      "The poor man determined to find another home, hoping that when they no longer met every day his enemy would forget all about him.",
      "An ochre love in the heart of all, an ochre love and the cold sea shores, dear. My blood is yours for the night, 'cause my fears are only little things like these cold seas and broken strings.",
      "Cardan's gaze catches mine, and I can't help the evil smile that pulls up the corners of my mouth. His eyes are bright as coals, his hatred a living thing, shimmering in the air between us like the air above black rocks on a blazing summer day.",
      "What you do as soon as you get up can underpin and affect your mood for the entire day. Therefore it is important to approach the day gently, without a sense of worry, tension or rush. Also, you need to start off by making sure your body is happy and comfortable, otherwise feel ill all day.",
      "Love is a command, not just a feeling. Somehow, in the romantic world of music and theater we have made love to be what it is not. We have so mixed it with beauty and charm and sensuality and contact that we have robbed it of its higher call of cherishing and nurturing.",
      "You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done!",
      "Perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall. She thought she understood. She would try to understand him because men were so different.",
      "Whoever talks about what does not concern him often hears what does not please him.",
      "In this grave hour, perhaps the most fateful in our history, I send to every household of my peoples, both at home and overseas, this message, spoken with the same depth of feeling for each one of you, as if I were able to cross your threshold and speak to you myself: for the second time in the lives of most of us, we are at war.",
      "I bet you're wondering how I knew about your plans to make me blue with some other guy you knew before. Between the two of us guys, you know I loved you more.",
      "Read the newspaper. What does it say? All bad. It's all bad. People have forgotten what life is all about. They've forgotten what it is to be alive. They need to be reminded. They need to be reminded of what they have and what they can lose. What I feel is the joy of life, the gift of life, the freedom of life, the wonderment of life!",
      "So they're finally here, performing for you. If you know the words, you can join in too. Put your hands together if you want to clap, as we take you through this monkey rap!",
      "When the snows fall and the white winds blow, the lone wolf dies but the pack survives.",
      "So this is it. You are scored on my heart, Clark. You were from the first day you walked in, with your ridiculous clothes and your bad jokes and your complete inability to ever hide a single thing you felt.",
      "I hope some day you'll join us and the world will be as one. Imagine no possessions, I wonder if you can. No need for greed or hunger, a brotherhood of man. Imagine all the people sharing all the world.",
      "It's one thing to question your mind; it's another to question your eyes and ears. But then again, isn't it all the same, our senses just mediocre inputs for our brain? Sure, we rely on them, trust they accurately portray the real world around us, but what if the haunting truth is they can't?",
      "Ever since your brother got taken down... I've had my eye on you. Because all that building resentment was written over your face. I know that when I see it. And I know just how much grudges like that... can cloud a person's vision.",
      "See, when you're a little kid, nobody ever warns you that you've got an expiration date. One day you're hot stuff and the next day you're a dirt sandwich.",
      "Sometimes I wonder why I spend the lonely nights dreaming of a song. The melody haunts my reverie, and I am once again with you. When our love was new, and each kiss an inspiration. Oh, but that was long ago, now my consolation is in the stardust of a song.",
      "You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.",
      "An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.",
      "Well I watch you tangle every weekend. It might start different but it ends up the same. One minute you're casually speaking. The next it all goes up and you pour fuel on the flame with your jerry can of words and tones.",
      "Take the fifteen minutes before homeroom every morning. What you do with those fifteen minutes says pretty much everything there is to say about you as a human being.",
      "Let's go in the garden. You'll see something waiting, right there where you left it, lying upside down. When you finally find it you'll see how it's faded. The underside is lighter when you turn it around.",
      "When you lose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown. And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone. And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around. So have a good drown, as you go down, all alone... Dragged down by the stone.",
      "They just use your mind and they never give you credit. It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it. Nine to five for service and devotion. You would think that I would deserve a fat promotion. Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me. I swear sometimes that man is out to get me.",
      "Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder. Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them. And some are given a chance to climb; they cling to the realm or the gods or love. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is.",
      "Outside the street's on fire in a real death waltz, between what's flesh and what's fantasy. And the poets down here don't write nothing at all. They just stand back and let it all be. And in the quick of a knife, they reach for their moment and try to make an honest stand, but they wind up wounded, not even dead.",
      "I wish we'll end up this crazy way before we burn our steam. I don't want to sound defeated, but if you still don't get it, you're never gonna get it. How could you be a friend of mine?",
      "Not only do we come into fairly regular contact with people who want to know what our family looks like, but we also must navigate a vast array of organizations and agencies that have their own definitions of family and may, at times, impose them on us.",
      "You can tie up a lot of resources by keeping a bugged phone line open. As long as it's open, they're supposed to keep listening. Say a few cryptic things now and then and they'll be stuck in their little van trying to figure out what the hell you're doing.",
      "A magician is strong because he feels pain. He feels the difference between what the world is and what he would make of it. Or what did you think that stuff in your chest was? A magician is strong because he hurts more than others. His wound is his strength.",
      "We stand against the small tide of those who want to make everyone unhappy with conflicting theory and thought.",
      "Moral of the story is: I chose a half measure when I should have gone all the way. I'll never make that mistake again. No more half measures, Walter.",
      "Sometimes she did not know what she feared, what she desired: whether she feared or desired what had been or what would be, and precisely what she desired, she did not know.",
      "It is no worse because I write of it. It would be no better if I stopped my most unwilling hand. Nothing can undo it; nothing can make it otherwise than as it was.",
      "Always seems to me you only see what people want you to see. How long's it gonna be before we get on the bus and cause no fuss? Get a grip on yourself, it don't cost much.",
      "The seaweed is always greener in somebody else's lake. You dream about going up there, but that is a big mistake. Just look at the world around you right here on the ocean floor. Such wonderful things surround you. What more is you lookin' for?",
      "I was selfish to assume you loved me more than you loved yourself even though I've never felt the same.",
      "There's a clocktower in Hereford, where the names of the dead are inscribed. We try to honor their deeds, even as their faces fade from our memory. Those memories are all that's left, when they have taken everything else.",
      "Hey you... did you ever realize what you'd become, and did you see that it wasn't only me you were running from? Did you know all the time but it never bothered you anyway, leading the blind while I stared out the steel in your eyes?",
      "Our minds are born festering with sin. Some are so blighted, they will never find redemption. The mind must not be pulled from the roots. My children are without blame, without fault - and without choice. For what is the value of will when the spirit is found wanting?",
      "No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue. I could not foresee this thing happening to you. If I look hard enough into the setting sun, my love will laugh with me before the morning comes.",
      "I sing the body electric, the armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them, they will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them, and discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of the soul.",
      "They burned the flag and they demonstrated against us; it's on the cover of the paper today. They have no respect. They have no idea what's going on over there, Mom - the men that are sacrificing their lives. People are dying every day over there, and nobody back here even seems to care.",
      "We live where the war is raging, chasing our crazy dreams.",
      "I dreamed a dream in time gone by, when hope was high and life worth living. I dreamed that love would never die. I dreamed that God would be forgiving. Then I was young and unafraid when dreams were made and used and wasted. There was no ransom to be paid, no song unsung, no wine untasted.",
      "The fear of death has disordered my reason and subjected me to delusions. And I became full of shame for none of my lineage ought to fear death more than the biting of a gnat.",
      "The horrors of the Inquisition are nothing compared to the fates your mind can imagine for your loved ones.",
      "Some people can read War and Peace and come away thinking it's a simple adventure story. Others can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and unlock the secrets of the universe.",
      "It won't always go your way, so you can't get trapped in this idea that just because you've imagined a possibility for yourself that you somehow deserve it. Your entitled mind is dead weight. Cut it loose. Don't focus on what you think you deserve. Take aim on what you are willing to earn!",
      "I want you to say that you know what I'm saying. But I need more, because I'll be you, you'll be me. There's lots and lots for us to see. There's lots and lots for us to do. She is electric, and I'll be electric too.",
      "To dream in isolation can be properly splendid to be sure; but to dream in company seems to me infinitely preferable.",
      "Round the world we'll go, does anybody know, love? If we're looking out on the day of another dream. If you can't get what you want then you come with me.",
      "I'm not the one who's lost with no direction, but you'll never see. You're so busy making masks with my name on them in all caps. You got the talking down, just not the listening.",
      "There's a simplicity to war: Attacking is the only secret. Dare, and the world yields. How quickly they forget that all it takes to change the course of history is the will of a single man.",
      "So tonight, sweet dreams, and sleep tight. I've been trying so hard, can't get you out of my mind and if this is how it has to be, just promise me you won't forget me, and I'll leave you with this lullaby, tonight...",

      "Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it. I don't think that was my point.",
      "Don't take anything personally - nothing others do is because of you. What others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream. When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won't be the victim of needless suffering.",
      "It's really hard to do nothing totally. Even just sitting here, like this, our bodies are churning, our minds are chattering. There's a whole commotion going on inside us.",
      "It is always important, I think, to be clear about what delights you: important, and more easily said than done, to know exactly what you'd do if you didn't have to do everything else.",

      "We used to look at the stars and confess our dreams, hold each other till the morning light. We used to laugh, now we only fight. Baby, are you lonesome now?",
      "I may be younger but I'll look after you. We're not in love but I'll make love to you. When you're not here I'll save some for you. I'm not him but I'll mean something to you. I'll mean something to you.",
      "If a tree falls in the forest and no one hears it fall, does it make sound or not? Hector had read a lot of books by then, he knew all the tricks and arguments of the philosophers. If someone makes a movie and no one sees it, does the movie exist or not? That's how he justified what he did.",
      "I don't want to talk if it makes you feel sad, and I understand you've come to shake my hand. I apologize if it makes you feel bad seeing me so tense.",
      "I been doin' this a long time. I ain't never said nothin' to no cop.",
      "There are times when all the world's asleep, the questions run too deep for such a simple man. Won't you please, please tell me what we've learned? I know it sounds absurd but please tell me who I am.",
      "Often I think this sad old world is whistling in the dark, just like a child who, late from school, walks bravely home through the park. To keep their spirits soaring and keep the night at bay, neither quite knowing which way they are going, they sing the shadows away.",
      "I was standing all alone in the world outside. You were searching for a place to hide. Lost and lonely, now you've given me the will to survive. When we're hungry, love will keep us alive.",
      "Her eyes, like windows, trickle in rain upon the pain getting deeper, though my love wants to relieve her. She walks alone from wall to wall. Lost in her hall, she can't hear me, though I know she likes to be near me.",
      "Imagination is the only weapon in the war against reality.",
      "If there were to be something non-empty, there would then be something called empty. However, there is nothing that is non-empty. How could there be something empty?",

      "I am the hope of the universe. I am the answer to all living things that cry out for peace. I am protector of the innocent. I am the light in the darkness. I am truth. Ally to good! Nightmare to you!",
      "I really don't think you have anything to worry about, Charlie Brown. After all, science has shown that a person's character isn't really established until he's at least five years old.",
      "I have a dream that one day the state of Alabama, whose governor's lips are presently dripping with the words of interposition and nullification, will be transformed into a situation where little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls and walk together as sisters and brothers.",

      "If you're willing to go through the battling to get to where you wanna get, who's got the right to stop you? Maybe you guys got something you never finished, something you really wanna do, something you never said to somebody - something! And you're told no, even after you pay your dues. Who's got the right to tell you that? Who? Nobody!",
      "You look in excellent health to me, Potter, so you will excuse me if I don't let you off homework today. I assure you that if you do die, you need not hand it in.",
      "Frodo and Sam stood as if enchanted. The wind puffed out. The leaves hung silently again on stiff branches. There was another burst of song, and then suddenly, hopping and dancing along the path, there appeared above the reeds an old battered hat with a tall crown and a long blue feather stuck in the band.",
      "Night was a very different matter. It was dense, thicker than the very walls, and it was empty, so black, so immense that within it you could brush against appalling things and feel roaming and prowling around a strange, mysterious horror.",
      "Some day, and that day may never come, I will call upon you to do a service for me. But until that day, consider this justice a gift on my daughter's wedding day.",
      "As passions are contagious, and the bulk of men are more guided by the opinions and pretended opinions of others than by their own, a large share of confidence, with a little share of argument, will be apt to go farther than all the argument in the world without confidence.",
      "I'd like to build the world a home and furnish it with love. Grow apple trees and honey bees and snow white turtle doves. I'd like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony. I'd like to hold it in my arms and keep it company.",
      "It's too late to articulate it, that empty feeling. You share the same fate as the people you hate. You build yourself up against others' feelings, and it left you feeling empty as a car coasting downhill. I have become such a negative person.",
      "You looked on amazed, and began to suspect yourself of being deaf - then the night came suddenly, and struck you blind as well. About three in the morning some large fish leaped, and the loud splash made me jump as though a gun had been fired.",
      "And if you were prejudiced, you'd walk around thinking that you're better than anybody else in the world. But I can honestly say, after spending these marvelous moments with you, you ain't better than anybody.",
      "No man's life can be encompassed in one telling. There is no way to give each year its allotted weight, to include each event, each person who helped to shape a lifetime. What can be done is to be faithful in spirit to the record and try to find one's way to the heart of the man...",
      "I don't believe in an interventionist God, but I know, darling, that you do. But if I did I would kneel down and ask him not to intervene when it came to you. Not to touch a hair on your head, to leave you as you are, and if he felt he had to direct you, then direct you into my arms.",
      "It makes no difference, it don't make any difference to me what a man does for a living, you understand. But your business is a little dangerous.",
      "I loved Jordan Catalano so much, and talked about him so much, and thought about him so much, it was like he lived inside me. Like he had taken possession of my soul, or something. And then one day I got over him!",
      "Don't know much about history. Don't know much biology. Don't know much about a science book. Don't know much about the French I took. But I do know that I love you, and I know that if you love me too, what a wonderful world this would be.",
      "I see something of God each hour of the twenty-four, and each moment then, in the faces of men and women I see God, and in my own face in the glass; I find letters from God dropped in the street, and every one is signed by God's name, and I leave them where they are, for I know that others will punctually come forever and ever.",
      "Is it sweeter to exist only in the mind or to exist both in the mind and in reality? Flipping out and wailing on guitars is much sweeter when someone is actually doing it. So when we conceive of the sweetest being ever, we are conceiving of the being that exists both in the mind and in reality.",
      "From being used so much, kneaded with sweat and sighs, the air in the room had begun to turn to mud.",
      "For it is not enough to have a good mind; the main thing is to apply it well. The greatest souls are capable of the greatest vices as well as the greatest virtues. And those who proceed only very slowly can make much greater progress, provided they always follow the right path, than those who hurry and stray from it.",
      "Heaven did not seem to be my home; and I broke my heart with weeping to come back to earth; and the angels were so angry that they flung me out into the middle of the heath on the top of Wuthering Heights; where I woke sobbing for joy.",
      "Still, we will let all this be a thing of the past, though it hurts us, and beat down by constraint the anger that rises inside us. Now I am making an end of my anger. It does not become me, unrelentingly to rage on.",
      "In and around the lake. Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there. One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you, ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too. Twenty four before my love you'll see, I'll be there with you.",
      "The idea that he did not really have control over the coming event was comforting for a moment, for it relieved him of the responsibility for making the decision himself - at least for a time.",
      "I love bagels even though they are one of mankind's most dangerous foods, which is something most people don't know. For instance, there's actually no safe way to slice a bagel. Except maybe you get somebody to do it for you. I mean you have no idea how many people have sliced an index finger in half along with a bagel.",
      "You are amoral, are you not? You are feeding off the violence and the despair of the drug trade. You're stealing from those who themselves are stealing the lifeblood from our city.",
      "It's enough for me to be sure that you and I exist at this moment.",
      "Wherever they might be they always remember that the past was a lie, that memory has no return, that every spring gone by could never be recovered, and that the wildest and most tenacious love was an ephemeral truth in the end.",
      "A question in your nerves is lit, yet you know there is no answer fit to satisfy, ensure you not to quit. To keep it in your mind and not forget that it is not he or she or them or it that you belong to.",
      "It's close to midnight, something evil's lurking in the dark. Under the moonlight you see a sight that almost stops your heart. You try to scream, but terror takes the sound before you make it. You start to freeze as horror looks you right between the eyes, you're paralyzed.",
      "Our customers are nervous about financial decisions because money is a massive stressor, so let's use reassuring words in our inline help hints, as well as live previews and confirmation patterns to improve their confidence.",
      "There was something in her, something that was... Pure Horror. Everything you were supposed to watch out for. Heights, fire, shards of glass, snakes. Everything that his mom tried so hard to keep him safe from.",
      "I never realized till now how ugly I am, because you're so beautiful.",
      "It was one of those days when it's a minute away from snowing and there's this electricity in the air, you can almost hear it. And this bag was, like, dancing with me. Like a little kid begging me to play with it. For fifteen minutes. And that's the day I knew there was this entire life behind things, and this incredibly benevolent force.",
      "And his dad's smile faded just a bit - the prodigy could read, but he could not see. And if only Colin had known that he was missing a piece, that his inability to see himself in the story of a circle was an unfixable problem, he might have known that the rest of the world would catch up with him as time passed.",
      "I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind. We all need something to live for.",
      "I let it fall, my heart, and as it fell you rose to claim it. It was dark and I was over until you kissed my lips and you saved me. My hands, they're strong, but my knees were far too weak to stand in your arms without falling to your feet.",
      "This island of merchants is home to many valuable goods. While the sail must come first, do not feel limited to buying only it. Once you have it, feel free to stock up on anything else you think you may need. But remember: there is no time to play. Come back immediately as soon as your errands are done.",
      "For example, tomorrow we will demonstrate to all interested parties a new and extremely interesting power source, which is atomic in nature and which can supply a form of electric power for entire countries for the cost of a few dollars.",
      "You're asking how do I really feel, and I'm asking now how is this real. Oh, love is a plan that we can't control. All I can hope, that I'll fill the role. No one will ever know how I feel for you. Throw me a lifeline.",
      "Nothing drives down real estate prices like a good old-fashioned gang war. Apart from an outbreak of plague, but that may be going too far in this case.",
      "The only preventive thing I do is wash clothes after buying them in a thrift shop - this after catching crabs from a pair of used pants. I was in my midtwenties at the time and probably would have itched myself all the way to the bone had a friend not taken me to a drugstore.",
      "Fernanda, on the other hand, looked for it in vain along the paths of her everyday itinerary without knowing that the search for lost things is hindered by routine habits and that is why it is so difficult to find them.",
      "Morning has broken like the first morning, blackbird has spoken like the first bird. Praise for the singing, praise for the morning, praise for them springing fresh from the world.",
      "We give it away with nothing left to lose. Got the strongest heart but still the skin can bruise. Only the climb will get you higher, defeat will make a fighter. Stare into the face of the truth.",
      "It is possible that I already had some presentiment of my future. The locked and rusted gate that stood before us, with wisps of river fog threading its spikes like the mountain paths, remains in my mind now as the symbol of my exile.",

      "I hope you never lose your sense of wonder. You get your fill to eat but always keep that hunger. May you never take one single breath for granted, God forbid love ever leave you empty handed.",
      "Everything happens for a reason. The system will be assessing your reaction to the painful premature termination of a treasured relationship, and will adjust and improve its profile of your eventual chosen one accordingly.",
      "It is only in the mysterious equations of love... that any logical reasons can be found. I'm only here tonight because of you. You are the reason I am. You are all my reasons. Thank you.",
      "I think you're gonna find - when all this stuff is over and done - I think you're gonna find yourself one smiling guy. Thing is, Butch, right now you got ability. But painful as it may be, ability don't last. Now that's a hard fact of life, but it's a fact of life you're gonna have to get realistic about.",
      "I never got to bat in the major leagues. I'd have liked to have had that chance just once, to stare down a big league pitcher. To stare him down, then just as he goes into his windup, wink. Make him think you know something he doesn't. That's what I wish for.",
      "Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change.",
      "That fear had been inside him for many years, it had lived with him, it had been another shadow ever since the night he awoke, shaken by a bad dream, and realized that death was not only a permanent probability, as he has always believed, but an immediate reality.",
      "The rich had been assured of his wealth and comfort, the toiler assured of his life and work. No doubt in that perfect world there had been no unemployed problem, no social question left unsolved.",
      "I began to realize how important it was to be an enthusiast in life. If you are interested in something, no matter what it is, go at it full speed. Embrace it with both arms, hug it, love it and above all become passionate about it. Lukewarm is no good.",
      "If you feel yourself hitting up against your limit, remember for what cause you clench your fists... remember why you started down this path, and let that memory carry you beyond your limit.",
      "Anything which has ended is finished. That which is perfect is finished. The perfect man is no exception to the rule. The perfect man of the past is made according to the rule of the past. The rule of the past is a law of injustice and hypocrisy. The revelation of the meaning of the law is revealed through the law itself.",
      "Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes - they call me on and on across the universe. Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box - they tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.",
      "Recalling the past dredges up regrets that make me want to die, and when I think of the future, the anxiety just makes me depressed. By process of elimination, you could say right now is my happiest time.",
      "How thick do you have to be to believe what a digital, pretend woman on the dashboard says, over what you can actually see out of the window. I mean, the sea, for example: It's big, it's blue, the top of it wobbles around and it's not suitable for motor vehicles. But you know that already. You don't drive into it!",
      "We are the world, we are the children. We are the ones who make a brighter day, so let's start giving. There's a choice we're making. We're saving our own lives. It's true we'll make a better day, just you and me.",
      "The rest of my attention is back at the offices of Facebook, where my colleagues and I are doing things that no one in this room, including and especially your clients, are intellectually or creatively capable of doing.",
      "But there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the process of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred.",
      "You do not understand even life. How can you understand death?",
      "Sometimes, when you meet a new operative, it's a good idea to open with an aggressive move. You learn about people when you make them play defense: their reflexes, weaknesses, how they handle themselves under pressure. And even if they are able to counter, it never hurts to know how far they're willing to go.",
      "It's not a game if you're not having fun. It doesn't mean anything if you just focus on winning or losing.",
      "Many rivers to cross but I can't seem to find my way over. Wandering, I am lost as I travel along the white cliffs of Dover. Many rivers to cross and it's only my will that keeps me alive. I've been licked, washed up for years, and I merely survive because of my pride.",
      "It is not difficult to wield a sword in one hand; the way to learn this is to train with two long swords, one in each hand. It will seem difficult at first, but everything is difficult at first.",
      "You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. And YOU are the one who'll decide where to go.",
      "If you want to leave, take good care. Hope you have a lot of nice things to wear, but then a lot of nice things turn bad out there.",
      "So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye? So you think you can love me and leave me to die? Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby! Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here! Nothing really matters, anyone can see. Nothing really matters. Nothing really matters to me, any way the wind blows.",
      "You crushed us to build your monarchy on the backs of our blood and bone. Your mistake wasn't keeping us alive. It was thinking we'd never fight back!",
      "I deserve it all. Let the cold world do its worst; one thing I know - there's a grave somewhere for me. The world may go on just as it's always done, and take everything from me - loved ones, property, everything - but it can't take that. Some day I'll lie down in it and forget it all, and my poor broken heart will be at rest.",
      "Never before had I known the sudden quiver of understanding that travels from word to brain to heart, the way a new language can move, coil, swim into life under the eyes, the almost savage leap of comprehension, the instantaneous, joyful release of meaning, the way the words shed their printed bodies in a flash of heat and light.",
      "If I had a world of my own, everything would be nonsense. Nothing would be what it is because everything would be what it isn't. And contrary-wise; what it is it wouldn't be, and what it wouldn't be, it would. You see?",
      "This is your last chance. After this there is no turning back. You take the blue pill: the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill: you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes. Remember, all I'm offering is the truth, nothing more.",
      "She, who always seems so happy in a crowd, whose eyes can be so private and so proud. No one's allowed to see them when they cry. She may be the love that cannot hope to last. May come to me from shadows of the past that I'll remember 'til the day I die.",
      "Many folk like to know beforehand what is to be set on the table; but those who have laboured to prepare the feast like to keep their secret; for wonder makes the words of praise louder.",
      "Hey you, out there in the cold, getting lonely, getting old, can you feel me? Hey you, standing in the aisles with itchy feet and fading smiles, can you feel me? Hey you, don't help them to bury the light. Don't give in without a fight.",
      "Have you seen the old man in the closed down market, picking up the papers with his worn out shoes? In his eyes you see no pride and hanging loosely at his side yesterday's paper, telling yesterday's news.",
      "As he watches through the door, his smile pulls in more and more. Wicked thoughts shape wicked ways, while we all crave, while we all crave. When the man yells at his son, when he finds the smoking gun. Don't you worry, little one, for we all crave, we all crave.",
      "When I really worry about something, I don't just fool around. I even have to go to the bathroom when I worry about something. Only I don't go. I'm too worried to go. I'm too worried to interrupt my worrying to go.",
      "The sooner your kids appreciate the value of work, the more successful they will be. Work is part of life. You work to earn money, put food on the table, and keep your homes orderly and clean. For your kids, work involves schoolwork, homework, and teamwork at home and in the community.",
      "Don't look back, keep your head held high. Don't ask them why because life is short and before you know you're feeling old and your heart is breaking.",
      "All that year the animals worked like slaves. But they were happy in their work; they grudged no effort or sacrifice, well aware that everything that they did was for the benefit of themselves and those of their kind who would come after them, and not for a pack of idle, thieving human beings.",
      "Never know how much I love you. Never know how much I care. When you put your arms around me, I get a fever that's so hard to bear - you give me fever. When you kiss me - fever when you hold me tight. Fever! In the morning. Fever all through the night.",
      "Persons attempting to find a motive in this narrative will be prosecuted; persons attempting to find a moral in it will be banished; persons attempting to find a plot in it will be shot.",
      "Maybe I'm not so different from everyone else after all. It's like somebody gave me a puzzle, but I don't have the box with the picture on it. So I don't know what the final thing is supposed to look like. I'm not even sure if I have all the pieces.",
      "What was the power that turned the worm into a moth? It was greater than any power the Builders had had, he was sure of that. The power that ran the city of Ember was feeble by comparison.",
      "You will become way less concerned with what other people think of you when you realize how seldom they do.",
      "Eating, bathing, having a girlfriend, having an active social life is incidental, it gets in the way of code time. Writing code is the primary force that drives our lives so anything that interrupts that is wasteful.",
      "Here he was writing a formula the accuracy of which was certain, but whose origin in his brain and way of discovery he did not explain and we could not guess.",
      "We can't define consciousness because consciousness does not exist. Humans fancy that there's something special about the way we perceive the world, and yet we live in loops as tight and as closed as the hosts do, seldom questioning our choices, content, for the most part, to be told what to do next.",
      "The evolution of language marked a great leap forward for our species. It boosted our cognitive abilities by webbing us together into larger, more powerful group minds. I believe that another quantum step in human cognition awaits us on the other side of direct linkage of our brains and minds to one another.",
      "See the stone set in your eyes, see the thorn twist in your side. I wait for you. Sleight of hand and twist of fate. On a bed of nails she makes me wait. And I wait without you.",
      "Sometimes he awoke with a feeling of fragments afloat in his sleep, but he couldn't seem to grasp them and put them together into something worthy of telling at the ritual.",
      "So I want you to get up now. I want all of you to get up out of your chairs. I want you to get up right now and go to the window. Open it and stick your head out and yell, \"I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore!\"",
      "Oh, my life is changing every day in every possible way.",
      "We're living on borrowed time here. Every minute of our life is a minute we steal from them! You see them out there. You know that when we die, we become them. You think we hide behind walls to protect us from the walking dead. Don't you get it? We are the walking dead.",
      "Over the field rang his clear voice calling: \"Death! Ride, ride to ruin and the world's ending!\"",
      "Come, sweetheart mine, don't sit and pine. Tell me of the cares that make you feel so blue. What have I done, answer me, hon. Have I ever said an unkind word to you? My love is true, and just for you, I'd do almost anything at any time. Dear, when you sigh, or when you cry, something seems to grip this very heart of mine.",
      "You gave me love and helped me find the sun, and every time that I was down you would always come around and get my feet back on the ground.",
      "I took her hand in mine, and we went out of the ruined place; and as the morning mists had risen long ago when I first left the forge, so the evening mists were rising now, and in all the broad expanse of tranquil light they showed to me, I saw no shadow of another parting from her.",
      "I don't know what is going to happen next year, no one does. But that's OK. I can handle it, I decide. It's just a harder gear, and I am ready. All I have to do is take a deep breath and ride.",
      "Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow.",
      "Darling, I am growing old, silver threads among the gold. Shine upon my brow today, life is fading fast away. But, my darling, you will be always young and fair to me. Yes, my darling, you will be always young and fair to me.",
      "She did not know what this chance would be, what wind would bring it her, towards what shore it would drive her.",
      "And yeah, I believe that there's a god. I believe that there is something out there other than my thoughts. I believe it was never science against religion; it wasn't poor against wealth; it was always me against myself, and I'm so scared who's going to win.",
      "Why'd you come, you knew you should have stayed. I tried to warn you just to stay away. And now they're outside ready to bust. It looks like you might be one of us.",
      "One day beneath the lemon tree, my love and I did lie. A girl so sweet that when she smiled the stars rose in the sky. We passed that summer lost in love beneath the lemon tree. The music of her laughter hid my father's words from me.",
      "The difference between treason and patriotism is only a matter of dates.",
      "Oh, you're leaving... I always knew that one day, this day would come. I've always known we're so different, and I'm not sad, because you have a lot ahead of you. I want you to take this. Don't forget me.",
      "Be impeccable with your word - speak with integrity. Say only what you mean. Avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others. Use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love.",
      "Stars, in your multitudes - scarce to be counted, filling the darkness with order and light. You are the sentinels, silent and sure, keeping watch in the night. You know your place in the sky, you hold your course and your aim, and each in your season returns and returns and is always the same.",
      "We think it is time that you recognized that you are masters in someone else's home. Despite the best intentions of the best of you, you must, in the nature of things, humiliate us to control us. General Dyer is but an extreme example of the principle... it is time you left.",
      "These rappers don't know what to do, 'cause all I did was act me like a Loony Tune. I'll give you all of me until there's nothing left, I swear this summer will be summer camp.",
      "Something's up, commander. We got called in for a rescue mission, but by the time we landed... it was too late. No one made it out alive. It was like the storm was targeting those survivors. I think we need to investigate the area.",
      "Tell you what it is, Mr. Reid. Now we're four misfits who don't belong together, we're playing for the other misfits. They're the outcasts, right at the back of the room. We're pretty sure they don't belong either. We belong to them.",
      "One man, one family driven from the land; this rusty car creaking along the highway to the west. I lost my land, a single tractor took my land. I am alone and bewildered.",
      "That we don't even care as restless as we are, we feel the pull in the land of a thousand guilts. And poured cement, lamented and assured. To the lights and town below, faster than the speed of sound, faster than we thought we'd go beneath the sound of hope.",
      "I know you don't get a chance to take a break this often. I know your life is speeding and it isn't stopping. Here, take my shirt and just go ahead and wipe up all the sweat, sweat, sweat. Lose yourself to dance.",
      "During my meditation training, I came to a place of deep silence. I was surrounded by light. Time and space disappeared. I had come to a place my master had never told me about.",
      "He may look like an idiot and talk like an idiot, but don't let that fool you. He really is an idiot.",
      "I am always saying \"Glad to've met you\" to somebody I'm not at all glad I met. If you want to stay alive, you have to say that stuff, though.",
      "My family loves each other so much, we live a thousand miles away and never stay in touch.",
      "Any finite number divided by infinity is as near to nothing as makes no odds, so the average population of all the planets in the Universe can be said to be zero. From this it follows that the population of the whole Universe is also zero, and that any people you may meet from time to time are merely the products of a deranged imagination.",
      "I won't say another word - not one. I know I talk too much, but I am really trying to overcome it, and although I say far too much, yet if you only knew how many things I want to say and don't, you'd give me some credit for it.",
      "Nothing in life is easy. But that's no reason to give up. You'll be surprised what you can accomplish if you set your mind to it.",
      "You think the dead we loved ever truly leave us? You think that we don't recall them more clearly than ever in times of great trouble? Your father is alive in you, Harry, and shows himself plainly when you have need of him.",
      "A dream is a gift from God. When you have a great yearning for something, your mind joins your heart and pushes for its fulfillment. Connecting mind to heart is essential for the creative force to be released. Reflect on those things in your life that bring you satisfaction.",
      "Purity in body and heart may please some - as for me, I make no boast. For, as you know, no master of a household has all of his utensils made of gold; some are wood, and yet they are of use.",
      "It was because of you. It was because you were by my side. I will buy you the world's longest-lasting batteries. Be with me until I die. Be with me forever. You are the most precious treasure of mine.",
      "All things will be produced in superior quantity and quality, and with greater ease, when each man works at a single occupation, in accordance with his natural gifts, and at the right moment, without meddling with anything else.",
      "My love is alive way down in my heart. Although we are miles apart, if you ever need a helping hand I'll be there on the double just as fast as I can.",
      "There's a love that's divine and it's yours and it's mine. Like the sun at the end of the day, we should give thanks and pray to the One.",
      "These mist-covered mountains are a home now for me, but my home is the lowlands and always will be. Someday you'll return to your valleys and your farms and you'll no longer burn to be brothers in arms.",
      "Have you ever wanted to sleep for a hundred or thousand years? Everything keeps going wrong and you don't see any hope of it getting better. You tell yourself, \"I'm sure things will get better,\" then another thing goes wrong.",
      "Lemon Boy and me started to get along together. I helped him plant his seeds and we'd mow the lawn in bad weather. It's actually pretty easy being nice to a bitter boy like him, so I got myself a citrus friend.",
      "When someone sues a wealthy individual, they are often met with layers of legal protection and often find that the wealthy person actually owns nothing. They control everything, but own nothing.",
      "I cheated on the intelligence test, I'm sorry! But I just want to say that the past few weeks have been great. Me and you have done stuff together, you've helped me out with things, and we're closer than we've ever been. I love you, Dad, and I think if something can bring us that close, it can't possibly be bad.",
      "Look, all I know is what they taught me at command school. There are certain rules about a war. Rule number one is young men die. And rule number two is doctors can't change rule number one.",
      "When you run with the Doctor it feels like it'll never end. But however hard you try you can't run forever. Everybody knows that everybody dies and nobody knows it like the Doctor. But I do think that all the skies of all the worlds might just turn dark if he ever for one moment accepts it.",
      "You can choose a ready guide in some celestial voice. If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice. You can choose from phantom fears and kindness that can kill. I will choose a path that's clear. I will choose freewill.",
      "Always look on the bright side of life. Always look on the light side of life. If life seems jolly rotten, there's something you've forgotten, and that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing. When you're feeling in the dumps, don't be silly chumps; just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing.",
      "I love the colorful clothes she wears and the way the sunlight plays upon her hair. I hear the sound of a gentle word on the wind that lifts her perfume through the air. I'm pickin' up good vibrations.",
      "Was life like that? You could look ahead to the future or back at the past, but the present moved too quickly to absorb. Maybe sometimes. Not today.",
      "He soon felt that the fulfillment of his desires gave him only one grain of the mountain of happiness he had expected. This fulfillment showed him the eternal error men make in imagining that their happiness depends on the realization of their desires.",
      "I was just a child when the stars fell from the skies, but I remember how they built a cannon to destroy them, and in turn how that cannon brought war upon us. War was an abstract idea, nothing more than a show on TV. As a child I only saw it as something that happened in some far away land - until that final day of summer.",
      "I'm the tallest of mountains. I am the roughest of waves. I'm the toughest of terrors. I am the darkest of days. I'm the last one that's standing, don't try to stand in my way, 'cause I've been up against better, just take a look at my face.",
      "I must have left my house at eight because I always do. My train, I'm certain, left the station when it was due. I must have read the morning paper going into town, and having gotten through the editorial no doubt I must have frowned.",
      "This used to be my playground, this used to be my childhood dream, this used to be the place I ran to whenever I was in need of a friend. Why did it have to end?",
      "If I had known you were going to come straight up to my office I would not have bothered hunting you in the first place.",
      "He's better at this than I've ever been at anything in my life. He's better at this than you'll ever be at anything. My son has a gift. He has a gift and when you acknowledge that then maybe we will have something to talk about.",
      "It wasn't always so clear, but the Rust programming language is fundamentally about empowerment: no matter what kind of code you are writing now, Rust empowers you to reach farther, to program with confidence in a wider variety of domains than you did before.",
      "The unknown future rolls toward us. I face it for the first time with a sense of hope, because if a machine, a Terminator, can learn the value of human life, maybe we can, too.",
      "We've known each other for many years but this is the first time you've ever come to me for counsel or for help. I can't remember the last time you invited me to your house for a cup of coffee, even though my wife is Godmother to your only child. But, let's be frank here. You never wanted my friendship and you were afraid to be in my debt.",
      "This is the first day of my life. I swear I was born right in the doorway. I went out in the rain, suddenly everything changed; they're spreading blankets on the beach. Yours is the first face that I saw. I think I was blind before I met you. Now I don't know where I am, I don't know where I've been, but I know where I want to go.",
      "In the all night cafe at a quarter past eleven, same old man sitting there on his own, looking at the world over the rim of his teacup, and each tea lasts an hour and he wanders home alone.",
      "Come and hold my hand. I want to contact the living. Not sure I understand this role I've been given. I sit and talk to God and he just laughs at my plans. My head speaks a language I don't understand.",
      "Whatever you are physically, male or female, strong or weak, ill or healthy, all those things matter less than what your heart contains. If you have the soul of a warrior, you are a warrior. Whatever the color, the shape, the design of the shade that conceals it, the flame inside the lamp remains the same. You are that flame.",
      "There's something waiting in the stratosphere, and it's waiting just to tell us what it's doing here.",
      "If there's one thing I learned from Rodrick, it's to set people's expectations real low so you end up surprising them by practically doing nothing at all.",
      "For attractive lips, speak words of kindness. For lovely eyes, seek out the good in people. For a slim figure, share your food with the hungry. For beautiful hair, let a child run his or her fingers through it once a day. For poise, walk with the knowledge that you never walk alone...",
      "I still don't know what it really means to grow up. However, if I happen to meet you, one day in the future, by then, I want to become someone you can be proud to know.",
      "The simple fact is that if you don't enjoy what you're doing and the people with whom you're doing it, then there is no possible way that you are ever going to do it as well as something you do enjoy. As some wise person once said, 'Life is not a dress rehearsal.' This is it!",
      "In an age as agitated as ours, it no longer suffices just to be advertised in the newspaper. To be advertised in this way is the same thing as being consigned to oblivion. If one is to be noticed, one must at least appear on the first page under a hand that points to and, as it were, announces or advertises the advertisement.",
      "Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book.",
      "I had a mother, I had a father, things - things that made sense. Do you remember things that made sense? Things you could count on? Before we all got so lost? What are we gonna do, Charlie? What am I gonna do?",
      "A pretty girl is like a melody that haunts you night and day. Just like the strain of a haunting refrain, she'll start up on a marathon and run around your brain. You can't escape, she's in your memory by morning, night, and noon. She will leave you and then come back again, a pretty girl is just like a pretty tune.",
      "Money, you've got lots of friends crowding around the door. When you're gone and spending ends, they don't come no more. Rich relations give crust of bread and such. You can help yourself, but don't take too much. Mama may have, papa may have, but God bless the child that's got his own. That's got his own.",
      "Whenever I'm alone with you, you make me feel like I am home again. Whenever I'm alone with you, you make me feel like I am whole again. Whenever I'm alone with you, you make me feel like I am young again. Whenever I'm alone with you, you make me feel like I am fun again.",
      "Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow. Hello, I've just got to let you know, 'cause I wonder where you are and I wonder what you do. Are you somewhere feeling lonely? Or is someone loving you? Tell me how to win your heart, for I haven't got a clue. But let me start by saying I love you.",
      "What is your obsession with this money? My father died when I was thirteen and I inherited this money. You don't think that every day I wake up and wish I could give it back? That I would give it back in a second if I could have one more day with him? But I can't, and that's my life and I deal with it.",
      "If there really is a complete unified theory that governs everything, it presumably also determines your actions. But it does so in a way that is impossible to calculate for an organism that is as complicated as a human being. The reason we say that humans have free will is because we can't predict what they will do.",
      "It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting, he thought, as he looked again at the position of the sun, and hurried his pace. He had suddenly remembered that, in Tarifa, there was an old woman who interpreted dreams.",
      "It used to make you so happy, the water. I think it's brave to try to be happy. You've gotten so comfortable being unhappy. Wouldn't it be wonderful to wake up in the morning and choose to be happy, to let the water wash everything away?",
      "Rhymes trap you into saying things you don't want to say. A word like \"fire\" is a good example. Before you know it you're reaching for desire, or to get higher, or calling someone a liar, or putting them on a pyre, even if that wasn't what you were going to say.",
      "I have no idea how I untangled the complicated process of words and thought, but it happened quickly and naturally. By the time I was two, all my memories had words, and all my words had meanings.",
      "We'd like to know a little bit about you for our files. We'd like to help you learn to help yourself. Look around you, all you see are sympathetic eyes. Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home.",
      "A Yoga master came to my office for a consult. I asked her to show me what made her pain worse. She sat on the floor in a pose fully twisting her spine, staying there for several minutes. It took her another few minutes to work through the pain to stand up. I stated, \"I think I know what is causing your pain - doing that exercise.\"",
      "Well, I can't recall one time in my life I've felt as lonely as I do tonight. I feel like I could lay down and get up no more. It's the damndest feeling; I never felt it before. Tonight I feel like an old violin soon to be put away and never played again.",
      "It's a praying mantis. Do you know how they mate? The male will sneak up on the female and she'll bite off his head and the rest of his body will keep on mating and when they're done she'll eat him. She'll eat the rest of him.",
      "If we do our job right, we never need to go to court. Look, the reason we're not a law firm? We don't have to play within the rules of the law. We're fixers, crisis managers. We make the problems of our clients go away, big or small. It's not about solving some crime, it's not about justice, it's about our client.",
      "But physical interpretation, which is in general a very sure guide and had been most often such for me, misled me in that case.",
      "In another time, another culture, he may have been a seer, a shaman priest. In our world he's a shoe salesman and lives among the shadows.",
      "Silence fell between them, as tangible as the dark tree shadows that fell across their laps and that now seemed to rest upon them as heavily as though they possessed a measurable weight of their own.",
      "Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know if you let people walk over you now they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life! Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?",
      "One of you go find the forest ranger. Since we're done with the May Day rites and it's still so early in the morning, my love will have a chance to hear the beautiful music of my hunting dogs barking as they chase their prey. Unleash the dogs in the western valley. Let them go. Now go find the forest ranger.",
      "I don't even like kids. They're always sticky like they've got jam on their hands. Even if there's no jam in the house, somehow, they've always got jam on their hands! I'm not the right guy to deal with that. I have no patience for jam hands!",
      "He is here, actually he was here! He's just nipped out to go to the toilet a few minutes ago. His drink is over there on the table by those barrels. The only problem is that no one has ever actually seen a toilet in RuneScape so he may take a little while.",
      "My teacher scolds me that I neglect education, she don't know I collect real education. My neighbor thinks that I am wasting my time, he don't know that he is wasting his time.",
      "Grown-up people do not know that a child can give exceedingly good advice even in the most difficult case.",
      "The market ceiling can function in the same way as when you hit your head on the ceiling. You quickly crouch down and rub the sore spot. First-mover advantage, scale advantage and double jeopardy indicate that it can be quite painful to hit your head on the ceiling.",
      "To teach how to live without certainty, and yet without being paralyzed by hesitation, is perhaps the chief thing that philosophy, in our age, can still do for those who study it.",
      "Furthermore, those not understanding this intensity will say you work all the time and probably resent it - you make them look bad. But for you, work is play.",
      "Oh baby, it's alright. It's alright to feel like a fat child in a push chair. Old enough to run. Old enough to fire a gun. Just give me this one night, just one night, to feel like I might be on the right path. Wise enough to know myself.",
      "What if all of this is a dream, and it isn't even our dream, it's that dog's dream? Maybe we're just existing in his mind and all of a sudden he'll go drink out of the toilet and we'll be gone. What will happen to us if that dog wakes up? It will be over.",
      "People know what they do; frequently they know why they do what they do; but what they don't know is what what they do does.",
      "If there were an answer I could give you to how the universe works, it wouldn't be special. It would just be machinery fulfilling its cosmic design. It would just be a big, dumb food processor. But since nothing seems to make sense, when you find something or someone that does, it's euphoria.",
      "And baseball was proof positive that democracy was real. A baseball box score, after all, is a democratic thing. It doesn't say how big you are or what religion you follow. It does not know how you voted or the color of your skin. It simply states what kind of ballplayer you were on any particular day.",
      "Old Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow, bright blue his jacket is, and his boots are yellow. None has ever caught him yet, for Tom, he is the Master: his songs are stronger songs, and his feet are faster.",
      "There is neither happiness nor unhappiness in this world; there is only the comparison of one state with another. Only a man who has felt ultimate despair is capable of feeling ultimate bliss. It is necessary to have wished for death in order to know how good it is to live.",
      "Okay, I don't know you, but I do know that you can fix your attitude. Do you wanna go home and feel sorry for yourself about a man you didn't wanna marry? Or do you wanna go talk to that cute boy who's been looking at you and give him your number before I throw him in my Benz for myself?",
      "If you loved someone, you loved him, and when you had nothing else to give, you still gave him love.",
      "To pass beyond is what I seek, I fear that I may be too weak. And those are few who've seen it through to glimpse the other side, the promised land is waiting like a maiden that is soon to be a bride.",
      "If I ruled the world, every man would see the world was his friend. There'd be happiness that no man could end, no my friend, not if I ruled the world. Every hand would be held up high, there'd be sunshine in everyone's sky.",
      "The lady said the Langston who wrote these words is a poet. Seems more like a magician to me, pulling words from my heart I never knew I had.",
      "Even if someone says they're doing fine, I'm sure that's just because they haven't noticed that they're truly lonely. I cried myself to sleep more times than I care to count, admittedly.",
      "Live, then, and be happy, beloved children of my heart, and never forget that, until the day God deigns to reveal the future to man, the sum of all human wisdom will be contained in these two words: Wait and hope.",
      "Somewhere out there, someone's saying a prayer that we'll find one another in that big somewhere out there.",
      "Let's just say this: you will feel the fear and pain known only to humans who've used the notebook. And when it's your time to die, it will fall on me to write your name in my death note. Be warned any human who's used a death note can neither go to heaven nor hell for eternity... That's all.",
      "For it is the nature of a log or stone to remain motionless on level ground.",
      "You gave me wings and made me fly, you touched my hand. I could touch the sky. I lost my faith, you gave it back to me, you said no star was out of reach.",
      "Every day that I don't beg Cardan for forgiveness over a feud he started is a day I win. He can humiliate me, but every time he does and I don't back down, he makes himself less powerful. After all, he's throwing everything he's got at someone as weak as I am and it's not working. He's going to take himself down.",
      "Take care where you're going, doing all the things you do. Even when you're away from me, I'm the closest thing to you. Come here when it's over, when you think you've lost your world. Come here with your restlessness, and I will calm you down. 'Cause it feels like home when you are here.",
      "He was a polished jazz player, whose poverty had less to do with his musical ability and more to do with his color. Henry had liked him immediately. Not because they were both outcasts, although if he really thought about it, that might have had a ring of truth to it - no, he liked him because of his music.",
      "We sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders and felt like free men. Hell, we could have been tarring the roof of one of our own houses. We were the lords of all creation. As for Andy - he spent that break hunkered in the shade, a strange little smile on his face, watching us drink his beer.",
      "Secretly, I want the box more than the jewelry. I want it to be all mine and never have to give it back. I could find any old thing. A pebble, a leaf, a pistachio shell and put it in the box. Like magic, these things would get to be special at least for a day.",
      "A rational investor should be willing to pay a higher price for a share the larger the growth rate of dividends and earnings.",
      "It took a lot of energy to ask that question. I wished he had answered it. I don't know when I'll be able to ask it again.",
      "To be my own master. Such a thing would be greater than all the magic and all the treasures in all the world! But what am I talking about? Let's get real here, it's not gonna happen. Genie, wake up and smell the hummus.",
      "I have often walked down this street before, but the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before. All at once am I several stories high knowing I'm on the street where you live.",
      "I'm so glad you came, I'm so glad you remembered, the walking through walls in the heart of December. The blindness of happiness, of falling down laughing, and I really believed that this time was forever.",
      "So they stood at the edge of the woods while all the other kids filed past. Katherine shot Jonah a white-faced worried look as she walked by, but there was nothing she could do.",
      "And who are you, the proud lord said, that I must bow so low? Only a cat of a different coat, that's all the truth I know.",
      "I don't believe you commissioned me to make an offer on the widow's claim to keep the regulators off you, Al. I think someone found something out there you want.",
      "I felt that even when they were polite they hardly saw me, that they would have begged the pardon of Jack the Bear, never glancing his way if the bear happened to be walking along minding his business. It was confusing. I did not know if it was desirable or undesirable.",
      "Growing to hate decisive moments, the only thing within a breath of real. So now I fall to my knees and beg in earnest to what powers may govern the sky. Just let me sleep one night without these dreams - these dreams that always haunt me.",
      "Welcome aboard the HMS majesty ship, where the drinks are free and the sails are made of cotton candy. We're going to be taking you to some of the most exotic known places in the world, so relax, enjoy, and don't forget to buy a raffle ticket in the parlor.",
      "If you know what you're worth, go and get what you're worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers... saying you ain't where you wanna be because of him or her or anybody! Cowards do that, and that ain't you! You're better than that!",
      "I had felt it growing, this feeling that had been hiding beneath the surface for some time now. I'd seen him, this person who never intended to be seen, and my faulty, silly, useless heart kept whispering his name. I clutched my chest, feeling my heart racing.",
      "In detective work, there's no winning or losing... there's no being inferior or superior... that's because there's always one and only one truth.",
      "It wasn't dark beyond the cave door - darkness would be something; darkness would mean that, with a little light, there'd be plenty to see. Darkness would be comforting, actually. This was so much worse.",
      "War must be, while we defend our lives against a destroyer who would devour all; but I do not love the bright sword for its sharpness, nor the arrow for its swiftness, nor the warrior for his glory. I love only that which they defend.",
      "I'm far from home, no place to go, but I don't feel cold. I've been so blind, just lost my mind, but all I have lost I find. Your face reminds me of these games, the memories don't erase. I'll never be the same anymore, I'm on the highest stop with no control...",
      "The presence of a noble nature, generous in its wishes, ardent in its charity, changes the lights for us: we begin to see things again in their larger, quieter masses, and to believe that we too can be seen and judged in the wholeness of our character.",
      "You stopped and smiled at me, asked me if I'd care to dance. I fell into your open arms and I didn't stand a chance. Now listen honey, I just want to be beside you everywhere.",
      "There's no truth in the courtroom. There's just your version of what happened versus theirs. That's how the justice system works. It's not what's right and what's fair. It's who tells the most convincing story.",
      "According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway. Because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.",
      "Very simple was my explanation, and plausible enough - as most wrong theories are!",
      "Light up your face with gladness. Hide every trace of sadness. Although a tear may be ever so near, that's the time you must keep on trying. Smile, what's the use of crying? You'll find that life is still worthwhile if you just smile.",
      "You can tell me that your dog ran away then tell me that it took three days. I've heard every joke, I've heard every one you'd say. You think there's not a lot goin' on. Look closer baby, you're so wrong. And that's why you can stay so long when there's not a lot goin' on.",
      "I suddenly had the impression that I had been left all alone, that everyone was shrinking away from me, avoiding me. You are, of course, right to ask who that everyone is, for although I've lived in Petersburg for eight years now, I haven't managed to make a single friend.",

      "All the blue light reflections that color my mind when I sleep. And the lovesick rejections that accompany the company I keep. All the razor perceptions that cut just a little too deep. Hey I can bleed as well as anyone, but I need someone to help me sleep.",
      "Take a drink, my friend, and say what you have in your heart. But you never drink. You never say. Because you are afraid of what you have in your heart!",
      "The clues we've uncovered during our search have led me to believe there's a strong possibility that Tom is actually a dog, not a small child as we had originally thought. Come to think of it, I seem to recall a young girl walking about the train with a dog in her arms. I intend to find her and confirm my suspicions.",
      "Like a stranger, I am on the outside looking in. I tore myself apart and I am left a skeleton. And it's been a long way down for me. It's been a long way down, but now I'm finally here. I will never understand.",
      "People talk to you a great deal about your education, but some good memory is perhaps the best education.",
      "I'll be there for you when the rain starts to pour. I'll be there for you like I've been there before. I'll be there for you 'cause you're there for me too.",
      "It's sometimes quite astonishing that a single, average life is enough to encompass so much that it's at all possible ever to have any success in one's work here.",
      "It is not knowledge, but the act of learning, not possession but the act of getting there, which grants the greatest enjoyment. When I have clarified and exhausted a subject, then I turn away from it, in order to go into darkness again.",
      "Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood.",
      "Remember the day I set you free, I told you you could always count on me. From that day on, I made a vow. I'll be there when you want me, some way, some how.",
      "You know what I'd like to be? A cartoon of some kind. You know, like when they get hit in the head with a frying pan or something, and their head looks like the frying pan, with the handle and everything? Then they just go boing and their head comes back to normal? Wouldn't that be great?",
      "But when a man suspects any wrong, it sometimes happens that if he be already involved in the matter, he insensibly strives to cover up his suspicions even from himself.",
      "Intrigued by that enigma, he dug so deeply into her sentiments that in search of interest he found love, because by trying to make her love him he ended up falling in love with her.",

      "And now the end is near, and so I face the final curtain. My friend, I'll say it clear. I'll state my case of which I'm certain, I've lived a life that's full. I traveled each and every highway, and more, much more than this, I did it my way.",
      "Have you ever experienced a time when no matter how hard you tried, you failed, and the time you spent felt wasted? If ever you feel such pangs of regret, try to remember this tale... the story of a young man's quest to save a sweet princess.",
      "Language is one of the keys to being human. It allows us to communicate with other human beings and to leave a legacy of our thoughts and actions for future generations. The dominant temporal lobe helps to process sounds and written words into meaningful information.",
      "I've seen it watching me, that misty thing without a face. It weaves my thoughts, lined them up in black lace. It buries my shape and leaves no trace. Tomorrow I will have no shame, and I will start again.",
      "I was reading about how countless species are being pushed toward extinction by man's destruction of forests. Sometimes I think the surest sign that intelligent life exists elsewhere in the universe is that none of it has tried to contact us.",
      "You're going in the drink and I am going to make a cup of tea. Underneath the floor boards is the famous river Thames. I hope for your sakes you can hold your breath for as long as it takes to boil that kettle. After that, I am going to ask you a question.",
      "Don't make assumptions - find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want. Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness and drama. With just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life.",
      "She hangs her head and cries on my shirt. She must be hurt very badly. Tell me what's making you sad, Li? Open your door, don't hide in the dark. You're lost in the dark, you can trust me 'cause you know that's how it must be.",
      "There are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity. He was one of them. What more is there to say?",
      "Every single night the same arrangement. I go out and fight the fight. Still, I always feel this strange estrangement. Nothing here is real, nothing here is right. I've been making shows of trading blows, just hoping no one knows that I've been going through the motions, walking through the part. Nothing seems to penetrate my heart.",
      "Every time I think of you I feel shot right through with a bolt of blue. It's no problem of mine but it's a problem I find, living a life that I can't leave behind. There's no sense in telling me the wisdom of a fool won't set you free. But that's the way that it goes, and it's what nobody knows, while every day my confusion grows.",
      "Ultimately, this is not about solving your problems. It's about realizing that there are no problems. Only situations - to be dealt with now, or to be left alone and accepted as part of the \"isness\" of the present moment until they change or can be dealt with.",
      "That's me in the corner, that's me in the spotlight losing my religion trying to keep up with you, and I don't know if I can do it. Oh no, I've said too much, I haven't said enough.",
      "Now John at the bar is a friend of mine, he gets me my drinks for free. And he's quick with a joke, or to light up your smoke, but there's someplace that he'd rather be.",
      "We don't understand what really causes events to happen. History is the fiction we invent to persuade ourselves that events are knowable and that life has order and direction. That's why events are always reinterpreted when values change. We need new versions of history to allow for our current prejudices.",
      "The whole point was to find a way to practice nuclear war without destroying ourselves. To get the computers to learn from mistakes we couldn't afford to make. Except I never could get Joshua to learn the most important lesson.",
      "There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have? So, let's just say I'm driving this buggy, and if you fix your attitude, you can ride along with me. Now you will see me one more time, if you do good. You will see me two more times, if you do bad.",
      "To make you a vampire they have to suck your blood. And then you have to suck their blood. It's like a whole big sucking thing. Mostly they're just gonna kill you.",
      "The alternative is unconsciousness, the default setting, the rat race, the constant gnawing sense of having had and lost some infinite thing.",
      "Today is the shadow of tomorrow. Today is the present future of yesterday. Yesterday is the shadow of today. The darkness of the past is yesterday. And the light of the past is yesterday. The days of yesterday are all numbered in sum, in the world once, because once upon a time there was a yesterday.",
      "Love is corny, when you get right down to it. It has two left feet. It trips over itself, because it is so large that it's awkward. It's sort of silly, done right. After all, how do you convey something that huge?",
      "Comfortable, Mullet? It seems sadly ironic that it's that tie that's got you into this pickle. Now you just take all the time you want. You can play some music if you like.",
      "Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.",
      "Haven't you ever happened to come across in a book some vague notion that you've had, some obscure idea that returns from afar and that seems to express completely your most subtle feelings?",
      "I don't think stand-up should really work on the page, so the very existence of this book is an indication of my ultimate failure as a comedian. The text of a stand-up set should be so dependent on performance and tone that it can't really work on the page, otherwise it's just funny writing.",
      "You know that I write slowly. This is chiefly because I am never satisfied until I have said as much as possible in a few words, and writing briefly takes far more time than writing at length.",
      "Sometimes all I want to do is head west on twenty in a car I can't afford with a plan I don't have. Just me, my music and the road.",
      "You know what I say? I say one down, a couple hundred thousand to go. I don't mean to get on my high horse, but I'm telling you, I do not like the deer. I'm sick of it; they're taking over. They're like rats. They're destroying the ecosystem. I see a dead deer on the side of the road and I think, \"That's a start.\"",
      "I will need my spectacles and a clear head. Today I broke my rules and I drank vodka. Tomorrow I will translate it, and then I will bring what I've done to your home.",
      "Writing is hard work. A clear sentence is no accident. Very few sentences come out right the first time, or even the third time. Remember this in moments of despair. If you find that writing is hard, it's because it is hard.",
      "There can be no covenants between men and lions, wolves and lambs can never be of one mind, but hate each other out and out and through.",
      "What it all comes down to is that everything is going to be quite alright. 'Cause I've got one hand in my pocket and the other one is flicking a cigarette.",
      "The big final rule for the comma is one that you won't find in any books by grammarians. It is quite easy to remember, however. The rule is: don't use commas like a stupid person. I mean it. More than any other mark, the comma requires the writer to use intelligent discretion and to be simply alert to potential ambiguity.",
      "Maybe you should come with me for a few weeks. See what happens. See how much you learn. Then, we'll talk about your future.",
      "If you challenge the conventional wisdom, you will find ways to do things much better than they are currently done.",
      "It's getting harder and harder for me to return to my true form. Some nights, I can't do it at all. What's causing it? Iron roads and machines that breathe smoke. Magic is draining from the world, and with it, we magical creatures grow ever weaker.",
      "Ocean man, take me by the hand, lead me to the land that you understand. Ocean man, the voyage to the corner of the globe is a real trip. Ocean man, the crust of a tan man imbibed by the sand. Soaking up the thirst of the land.",
      "You held me down, but I got up, already brushing off the dust. You hear my voice, you hear that sound like thunder, gonna shake your ground. You held me down, but I got up. Get ready 'cause I've had enough. I see it all, I see it now.",
      "You asked me why I don't have original art? I've had three different names and a dozen different aliases because of you. And to be an artist, you have to know who you are.",
      "You choose to be hurt rather than to hurt others, right? You're nice and wonderful. But while it seems like you are choosing both, you're really forsaking both.",
      "Sometimes we talk all night long, we don't shut up. And when it's late we'll say we're still wide awake so... We love to talk about how you'll come up to visit me. And we'll rent a car and we'll drive upstate.",
      "All I could think of was that the teachers must've found the illegal stash of candy I'd been selling out of my dorms room. Or maybe they'd realized I got my essay on Tom Sawyer from the Internet without ever reading the book and now they were going to take away my grade. Or worse, they were going to make me read the book.",
      "It's a human sign when things go wrong, when the scent of her lingers and temptation's strong. Into the boundary of each married man, sweet deceit comes calling and negativity lands.",
      "I think you're a lonely person. I see all these phones and all this stuff on your desk. It means nothing.",
      "Gax is a name you should not give to your child at all. It's only in the book because my kids are beside me as I'm writing and they absolutely insisted. Keep this in mind, prospective parents, if you're planning to work from home.",
      "I've been thinking lots about my life and how quick I'd wash it down the drain. Past tense, the future, nothing matters now. I act on my own and I'm to blame. Living's a wicked dream, where things turn out all wrong. We're all so weak, no matter how strong.",
      "With gene therapy, we can remove those genes which we know may lead to sickness or disease, and at the same time, splice in genes with beneficial effects such as resistance to cancer for example.",
      "I believe that for every one of these anxious, anguished people who have come here this evening there must be hundreds of others also touched by the implanted vision who never made it this far. It's simply because they never watched the television. Or perhaps they watched it but never made the psychic connection.",
      "Samatha is a state in which the mind is brought to rest, focused only on one item and not allowed to wander. When this is done, a deep calm pervades body and mind, a state of tranquility which must be experienced to be understood.",
      "You found something else. In that cell you found something that mattered more to you than life. It was when they threatened to kill you unless you gave them what they wanted... you told them you'd rather die. You faced your death, Evey. You were calm. You were still.",
      "I sit at my table and wage war on myself. It seems like it's all, it's all for nothing. I know the barricades and I know the mortar in the wall breaks. I recognize the weapons, I used them well. This is my mistake. Let me make it good. I raised the wall and I will be the one to knock it down.",
      "Most people believe that reality is truth and appearances are deceiving. But those of us who know the Moon Arcanum understand we can only truly know the appearance itself. You can never touch the so-called reality that lies just beyond the reach of your own perception.",

      "Home will always be here unseen out of sight, where I disappear and hide. I think dreamy things as I'm waving goodbye, so I'll spread out my wings and fly.",
      "Time, dear friend, time brings round opportunity; opportunity is the martingale of man. The more we have ventured the more we gain, when we know how to wait.",
      "The Minipirates had little iron hooks instead of hands and wooden stumps instead of proper legs, nor did I ever see one without an eyepatch. At first I thought they'd been wounded during their reckless attempts to board a prize, but I later learned that they were born that way, complete with hats and moustaches.",
      "In the beginning there was only a small amount of injustice abroad in the world, but everyone who came afterwards added their portion, always thinking it was very small and unimportant, and look where we have ended up today.",
      "Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine.",
      "It led me by the hand, as if to fill the niches in the memories in my oozing brain fluid. Without even a destination, we kept walking. Disgusting clouds were floating in the sky. I already know what will happen to me the next time I wake up.",
      "No matter what they call us, however they attack, no matter where they take us, we'll find our own way back. I can't deny what I believe, I can't be what I'm not. I know I'll love forever, I know no matter what.",

      "The time has come, to say fair's fair. To pay our rent, now, to pay our share. The time has come, a fact's a fact. It belongs to them, we're gonna give it back. How do we dance when our earth is turning? How do we sleep when our beds are burning?",
      "If anybody asks you if you in this game, you tell 'em you in it for life, a'ight? You play it hard, you play it tight, and you make sure they know you gonna stand by your people. No loose talk, no second thoughts and no snitching. Play it like that.",

      "I tried several times to call her, but after the first call, she wouldn't come to the phone any longer. I also sent flowers but with no luck. The smell of the flowers only made me sicker. The headaches got worse. I think I got stomach cancer. I shouldn't complain though. You're only as healthy as you feel.",
      "I find it wholesome to be alone the greater part of the time. To be in company, even with the best, is soon wearisome and dissipating. I love to be alone. I never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude.",

      "Look and think as far ahead as possible. Often, a driver's natural reaction is to look at the wall or the point you're just about to get to. That's not enough.

      "One, don't pick up the phone. You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone. Two, don't let him in. You'll have to kick him out again. Three, don't be his friend. You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning, and if you're under him, you ain't getting over him.",

      "Even a few people leaving would reverberate through the entire user base. The users are interconnected; that is the whole point. College kids are online because their friends are online, and if one domino goes, the other dominoes go. Don't you get that?",
      "But sometimes illumination comes to our rescue at the very moment when all seems lost; we have knocked at every door and they open on nothing until, at last, we stumble unconsciously against the only one through which we can enter the kingdom we have sought in vain a hundred years - and it opens.",

      "What would you think if I sang out of tune? Would you stand up and walk out on me? Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song and I'll try not to sing out of key. Oh I get by with a little help from my friends.",
      "My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all. The morning rain clouds up my window, and I can't see at all. And even if I could it'd all be gray, but your picture on my wall. It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad.",
      "Very often research which has deeply interested me while I was investigating it loses its interest for me just after I have the solution, unhappily at a time which coincides with the period when I have to record it.

      "The naked cannot clothe the poor in spirit with oxygen, and the wine I tasted reminded me of the night she took advantage of my advances rather than the blood sacrifice that I can make a better decision.",
      "I still want to smack him. Or remind him that the last transfer we had from Abnegation, who is sitting right next to him, managed to knock out some of his teeth, so who knows what this next one will do.",
      "At night I'm driving in your car, pretending that we'll leave this town. We're watching all the streetlights fade. And now you're just a stranger's dream, I took your picture from my frame. And now you're nothing like you seem, your shadow fell like last night's rain.",
      "I have these thoughts so often, I ought to replace that slot with what I once bought; 'cause somebody stole my car radio and now I just sit in silence.",
      "I called Betsy again at her office and she said maybe we'd go to a movie together after she gets off work tomorrow. That's my day off. At first she hesitated but I called her again and then she agreed.",
      "Well, that's the heart of our problem isn't it? You don't trust me. You still don't trust me. I may be a ward of the state, and I will do my job for the FBI, but as far as my personal life goes, we are done. We're done.",
      "Something inside me has always been there. But now it's awake. And I don't know what it is or where it came from, but I need help.",
      "Whipped cream isn't whipped cream at all if it hasn't been whipped with whips, just like poached eggs isn't poached eggs unless it's been stolen in the dead of the night.",
      "Being able to quit things that don't work is integral to being a winner. Going into a project or job without defining when worthwhile becomes wasteful is like going into a casino without a cap on what you will gamble: dangerous and foolish.",
      "Well, isn't this great, we've all learned something. Tony can't choose who his sister's gonna fall for, Monica can't choose who she's gonna fall for, and I think that I've learned the greatest lesson of all. I love being lifted.",
      "And the great owners, who must lose their land in an upheaval, the great owners with access to history, with eyes to read history and to know the great fact: when property accumulates in too few hands it is taken away. And that companion fact: when a majority of the people are hungry and cold they will take by force what they need.",
      "Is it a shame that I can't accept love? Am I too burned out to move towards what will keep me alive or too smart to get pulled into someone else's world?",
      "There is a theory which states that if anybody ever discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is another theory which states that this has already happened.",
      "It is vitally important for us to keep engaging with the world, with people whose lives are different from our own. Travel opens minds and hearts, expands our thinking, and breeds tolerance - all things that are fundamentally good for societies.",
      "I would rather not have upset him, but I couldn't see any reason to change my life. Looking back on it, I wasn't unhappy. When I was a student, I had lots of ambitions like that. But when I had to give up my studies I learned very quickly that none of it really mattered.",
      "One ring to rule them all, one ring to find them, one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.",
      "It's not time to make a change. Just sit down and take it slowly. You're still young, that's your fault, there's so much you have to go through. Find a girl, settle down. If you want, you can marry. Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy.",
      "The withered leaves collect at my feet and the wind begins to moan. Memory, all alone in the moonlight. I can dream of the old days, life was beautiful then. I remember the time I knew what happiness was. Let the memory live again.",
      "I make my living off the evening news. Just give me something, something I can use. People love it when you lose. They love dirty laundry.",
      "There she goes. There she goes again, racing through my brain. And I just can't contain this feeling that remains.",
      "If one day I could get out of here, I would allow myself to be crazy. Everyone is indeed crazy, but the craziest are the ones who don't know they're crazy; they just keep repeating what others tell them to.",
      "You're not like the others. I've seen a few; I know. When I talk, you look at me. When I said something about the moon, you looked at the moon, last night.",
      "Before me there stands an opportunity, there for the taking in this moment - this exact moment. I shall prepare myself to face a monster of which only I may conquer. Conjure the power bestowed upon our souls, conjure the power.",
      "In this particular instance it is not at all far-fetched to think of it as a piercing ray of light, penetrating the chromatic coils and darkness of the storm and magically initiating the process of dispersal.",
      "If I'm curt with you it's because time is a factor. I think fast, I talk fast and I need you guys to act fast if you wanna get out of this. So, pretty please with sugar on top. Clean the car!",
      "Liquor dealers had to be where they could run into people who might buy their consignments like detectives had to be where they were likeliest to hear the latest about a big tanker full of grain alcohol that for some reason hadn't shown up yet.",
      "When I lay with you I could stay there. Close my eyes, feel you here forever. You and me together, nothing gets better. I set fire to the rain, watched it pour as I touched your face. Well, it burned while I cried, 'cause I heard it screaming out your name.",
      "I know you, I walked with you once upon a dream. I know you, the gleam in your eyes is so familiar a gleam. Yet I know it's true that visions are seldom all they seem, but if I know you, I know what you'll do - you'll love me at once, the way you did once upon a dream.",
      "Dreams. Each man longs to pursue his dream. Each man is tortured by this dream, but the dream gives meaning to his life. Even if the dream ruins his life, man cannot allow himself to leave it behind. In this world, is man ever able to possess anything more solid, than a dream?",
      "There are many ways to get out; surrender is one, losing is another. Winning, cheating, which I don't recommend, but you have to do something. You have to have a strategy. See the number one rule in chess is this; whatever you do, don't play the other person's game. Play your own... Your move.",
      "A necessary sacrifice to bring peace to this planet. We can not let the humans pay for our mistakes. It's been an honor serving with you all. Autobots, roll out!",
      "Whether this tale be true or false, none can tell, for none were there to witness it themselves.",
      "The prize returns to me. Did you imagine that I would let you steal it from me? You what? That jewel belongs to my father and you know it. Your father, a good-for-nothing scavenger just like his daughter!",
      "The men in the room suddenly realized that they didn't want to know her better. She was beautiful, but she was beautiful in the way a forest fire was beautiful: something to be admired from a distance, not up close.",
      "I have long loved you, and loved you even before I knew that I did.",
      "If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue to be; and if all else remained, and he were annihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty stranger.",
      "If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room would you trust it? I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when you're in the mood for empathy, there's blood on my pen.",
      "What is finished is the idea that this great country is dedicated to the freedom and flourishing of every individual in it. It's the individual that's finished. It's the single, solitary human being that's finished. It's every single one of you out there that's finished, because this is no longer a nation of independent individuals.",
      "And these medications have a legitimate use. They've helped a lot of people. It's a generational thing. You know teenagers always find a way to abuse something. And why not, right? Being zonked out of your mind is a lot more fun than dealing with your problems.",
      "Well, things are getting pretty serious right now. I mean, we chat online for, like, two hours every day so I guess you could say things are gettin' pretty serious.",
      "What is the point of being alive if you don't at least try to do something remarkable?",
      "There is no good and evil, there is only power and those too weak to seek it.",
      "The real evil is the power to kill people. Someone who finds himself with that power is cursed. No matter how you use it, anything obtained by killing people can never bring true happiness.",
      "If I had the power to prevent my own birth I should certainly never have consented to accept existence under such ridiculous conditions.",
      "Are you telling me that not only did you invent a secret plan to fight inflation but now you don't support it?",
      "What we do know is that, as the chemical window closed, another awakening took place; that the human spirit is more powerful than any drug - and that is what needs to be nourished: with work, play, friendship, family. These are the things that matter. This is what we'd forgotten - the simplest things.",
      "Finally, sparing neither labor nor expense, I succeeded in constructing for myself so excellent an instrument that objects seen by means of it appeared nearly one thousand times larger and over thirty times closer than when regarded with our natural vision.",
      "We frequently pass so near to happiness without seeing, without regarding it, or if we do see and regard it, yet without recognizing it.",
      "The morning sun in all its glory greets the day with hope and comfort too. And you fill my life with laughter, you can make it better.",
      "Really knowing is good. Not knowing, or refusing to know, is bad, or amoral, at least. You can't act if you don't know. Acting without knowing takes you right off the cliff.",
      "Opening your eyes is all that is needing. The heart lies and the head plays tricks with us, but the eyes see true. Look with your eyes. Hear with your ears. Taste with your mouth. Smell with your nose. Feel with your skin. Then comes the thinking, afterward, and in that way knowing the truth.",
      "There's no such thing as a painless lesson, they just don't exist. Sacrifices are necessary. You can't gain anything without losing something first. Although if you can endure that pain and walk away from it, you'll find that you now have a heart strong enough to overcome any obstacle. Yeah... a heart made fullmetal.",
      "I can't perform under pressure. That's why I never play anything for money, I choke. I could choke tonight. And she works in my office, can you imagine? She goes around telling everyone what happened? Maybe I should cancel, I have a very bad feeling about this.",
      "On some shelf in some hexagon, it was argued, there must exist a book that is the cipher and perfect compendium of all other books, and some librarian must have examined that book; this librarian is analogous to a god.",
      "I was trying to feel some kind of good-bye. I mean I've left schools and places I didn't even know I was leaving them. I hate that. I don't care if it's a sad good-bye or a bad good-bye, but when I leave a place I like to know I'm leaving it. If you don't you feel even worse.",
      "Pork and beans are actually cooked in the can. One fairly large piece of pork is placed in the can before cooking. After being heated during processing, it melts down to the size you see in the can, its flavor having permeated the beans.",
      "If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money.",
      "And in the world a heart of darkness, a firezone, where poets speak their hearts then bleed for it. Jara sang, his song a weapon, in the hands of love. You know his blood still cries from the ground. It runs like a river to the sea. We run like a river runs to the sea.",
      "Everyone always wants new things. Everybody likes new inventions, new technology. People will never be replaced by machines. In the end, life and business are about human connections. And computers are about trying to murder you in a lake. And to me the choice is easy.",
      "How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants. I just heard it as you must have heard it and that's not good. Let me start again. I'm a paleontologist, you'll be there with us and the touching refers only to bones - fossils!",
      "Seeing someone lose it like that. You know, it reminded me of how I feel sometimes. Like I'm on the verge of just blowing up. All the stress and pressure and anxiety just bubbling up. But I'm never able to let it out like that. You know, I just keep it inside.",
      "Your problem is you spent your whole life thinking there are rules. There aren't. We used to be gorillas. All we had is what we could take and defend. The truth is, you're more of a man today than you were yesterday.",
      "And I have one of those very loud, stupid laughs. I mean if I ever sat behind myself in a movie or something, I'd probably lean over and tell myself to please shut up.",
      "You've been confusing since the day I met you. Another night chasing, this feels like home. Since I've been miles away, no change. Outsider inside looking dazed. Just wash the glitter off your face and go home.",
      "Well then, from out of nowhere, a huge tidal wave lifted me, tossed me like a cork, and I found myself right on top of him - face to face with the blowhole. I could barely see from the waves crashing down upon me, but I knew something was there. So I reached my hand in, felt around, and pulled out the obstruction.",
      "Today you are you, that is truer than true. There is no one alive who is youer than you.",
      "If I lay here, if I just lay here, would you lie with me and just forget the world?",
      "To win back my youth, there is nothing I wouldn't do - except take exercise, get up early, or be a useful member of the community.",
      "Don't let us forget that the causes of human actions are usually immeasurably more complex and varied than our subsequent explanations of them.",
      "Well, the problem is, it's not easy for me to think of ways to improve myself, because I'm pretty much one of the best people I know.",
      "Well, it just so happens, this hacienda comes with its very own private beach. And this private beach just so happens to look particularly beautiful bathed in moonlight. And there just so happens to be a full moon out tonight.",
      "Fly me to the moon and let me play among the stars. Let me see what spring is like on Jupiter and Mars. In other words, hold my hand. In other words, darling kiss me. Fill my heart with song and let me sing forevermore. You are all I long for, all I worship and adore. In other words, please be true. In other words, I love you.",
      "I can practically see your face and another revolutionary falls from grace. Hear the thunder in your brain. Not enough sunshine, too much rain.",
      "When you decide to be something, you can be it. That's what they don't tell you in the church. When I was your age they would say we can become cops, or criminals. Today, what I'm saying to you is this: when you're facing a loaded gun, what's the difference?",
      "We fight every night for something. When the sun sets, we're both the same. Half in the shadows, half burned in flames. We can't look back for nothing. Take what you need, say your goodbyes. I gave you everything and it's a beautiful crime.",
      "Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown, picks up the letter that's lying there. Standing alone at the top of the stairs, she breaks down and cries to her husband.",

      "Come on and love me just a little bit. I'm gonna teach you how to sing it out. Come on, let me show you what it's all about.",
      "Fortunately you have got someone who relies on you. We started out as friends, but the thought of you just caves me in. The symptoms are so deep. It is much too late to turn away. We started out as friends.",
      "It's strange, but the way you look right now sort of looks like this tree. It looks all dark and gloomy, almost like it could start crying any second now. How sad...",
      "I'm not sure what he thinks is going to happen, but I've decided I'm going to write in it every day if I can.",
      "I've never tried to keep a specific person alive before, and it's much more troublesome than I would have believed. But that's probably just because it's you. Ordinary people seem to make it through the day without so many catastrophes.",
      "A little bit of Monica in my life, a little bit of Erica by my side, a little bit of Rita's all I need, a little bit of Tina's what I see, a little bit of Sandra in the sun, a little bit of Mary all night long, a little bit of Jessica here I am, a little bit of you makes me your man.",
      "No, the goal of war is not to kill. The goal of war is to win. By surrounding the enemy, you would force him only to fight more desperately. If you surround him on three sides and leave him an escape route, he will leave your land and there will be less blood spilled on both sides. For a warrior of the Mandinka, courage is not enough.",
      "Sometimes you're the windshield, sometimes you're the bug. Sometimes it all comes together baby. Sometimes you're a fool in love. Sometimes you're the Louisville Slugger. Sometimes you're the ball. Sometimes it all comes together baby. Sometimes you're going to lose it all.",
      "There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions.",
      "I've taken my bows and my curtain calls. You brought me fame and fortune, and everything that goes with it. I thank you all. But it's been no bed of roses, no pleasure cruise. I consider it a challenge before the whole human race, and I ain't gonna lose.",
      "I don't want tickets, I need you to find me a painting, a classic, been nicked out of Lenny's house. And since you got more feet on the street than coppers on the beat, I'd like you to assist. I'll leave you a little livener. There's a large twenty to get some tongues wagging.",
      "Every night, I live and die, feel the party to my bones. Watch the wasters blow the speakers, spill my guts beneath the outdoor light. It's just another graceless night.",
      "But the queen - too long she has suffered the pain of love, hour by hour nursing the wound with her lifeblood, consumed by the fire buried in her heart. His looks, his words, they pierce her heart and cling - no peace, no rest for her body, love will give her none.",
      "It is something to be able to paint a particular picture, or to carve a statue, and so to make a few objects beautiful; but it is far more glorious to carve and paint the very atmosphere and medium through which we look, which morally we can do. To affect the quality of the day, that is the highest of arts.",
      "I appreciate but can't accept this thank you note that's sealed with your last breath, and I won't stand aside and listen to you give up.",
      "That's great Rachel, but I'm on my third glass of chardonnay and I don't think you called me over here to tell me you submitted your application to the bar, or that you're putting your foot down with Louis.",
      "I can and do say that nothing human beings have ever before attempted in the entire nutty history of the race even approaches this in absolute fascination. When I first understood what this project is about I didn't sleep for two nights, and I don't mean in the usual way; I mean I literally did not sleep.",
      "We live in an age when people do more writing than they have at any other time in history. Not only have computers made it easier to produce clean texts, but they've also allowed average writers to create documents that twenty years ago would have required professional designers.",
      "Open to everything happy and sad, seeing the good when it's all going bad. Seeing the sun when I can't really see, hoping the sun will at least look at me. Focus on everything better today; all that I needed I never could say. Hold on to people - they're slipping away. Hold on to this while it's slipping away.",
      "First time we had dinner, you asked me what I wanted from you. And the first time we kissed, I realized that I don't want anything... except you. And now I'm asking if you'll go on one more adventure with me. Sara Ellis, will you marry me?",
      "Take me home to the friends I've always known. Take me home, back to the place where I belong. A distant coast line, what peaks insight, washing the white of that ocean's tide.",
      "And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.",
      "For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of long before I knew someone warm like you would make my dreams come true.",
      "I am the happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I laugh.",
      "Hanging by threads of palest silver, I could have stayed that way forever. Bad blood and ghosts wrapped tight around me, nothing could ever seem to touch me. I lose what I love most; did you know I was lost until you found me?",
      "Look at the night and it don't seem so lonely. We filled it up with only two, and when I hurt, hurting runs off my shoulder. How can I hurt when I'm holding you?",
      "Come to me now and rest your head for just five minutes, everything is good. Such a cozy room, the windows are illuminated by the evening, sunshine through them, fiery gems for you, only for you.",
      "Works of art participate in our lives; we are not just distant observers of their lives. They are in conversation among themselves and with us.",
      "So when you find yourself locked onto an unpleasant train of thought, heading for the places in your past where the screaming is unbearable, remember there's always madness. Madness is the emergency exit.",
      "I will not vanish, you will not scare me. Try to get through it, try to push through it. You were not thinking that I will not do it. They be lovin' someone and I'm another story. Take the next ticket, get the next train. Why would I do it? Anyone'd think that.",
      "I open up the paper. There's a story of an actor who had died while he was drinking. He was no one I had heard of. And I'm turning to the horoscope and looking for the funnies when I'm feeling someone watching me.",
      "With all due respect ma'am, I'm done wasting my breath on you, because the purpose of this hearing was to determine if Mike Ross had reformed. But you don't seem to be interested in that because you've already made your mind up.",
      "The explosion would be just the right size to maximize the amount of paperwork your lab would face. If the explosion were smaller, you could potentially cover it up. If it were larger, there would be no one left in the city to submit paperwork to.",
      "I have to disagree. I make good life choices. Mostly because they're forced on me, but I make them. And I find myself in unpleasant situations all the time. You know why? Because even if you have a choice it can and will be taken away from you.",
      "For years I've been rushing around, taking whatever I fancied, not giving a tinker's curse for those I hurt. Yet here I am... with riches and reputation, feeling no wiser than when I left home. Yet when I turn around, and look at the course I've run... there's not a man or woman that I love left standing beside me.",
      "But maybe this isn't the end of the road, maybe it's a stop-off, a moment to reflect before moving on. Because that's how we honor those we've lost: by looking forward, not back. You see, this is one of those stories with a moral. And the moral is simply this: life persists.",
      "Too many times we stand aside and let the waters slip away 'til what we put off 'til tomorrow has now become today. So don't you sit upon the shoreline and say you're satisfied. Choose to chance the rapids and dare to dance the tide.",
      "Heaven, I'm in heaven, and my heart beats so that I can hardly speak, and I seem to find the happiness I seek when we're out together dancing, cheek to cheek. Heaven, I'm in heaven, and the cares that hang around me through the week seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak when we're out together dancing, cheek to cheek.",
      "Punishment and negative reinforcement are opposites. Punishment is when something bad happens to you because of something you did; negative reinforcement is when something bad stops happening to you, or doesn't start happening to you in the first place, because of something you did. Punishment is bad, and negative reinforcement is good.",
      "If there is a design or pattern on our china, we eat until we can see the design clearly. If you're on a diet, eat from plates with no design - or even better, from plain white china. Without the design present to influence you, you have less incentive to clean your plate.",
      "Man, do not pride yourself on your superiority to the animals, for they are without sin, while you, with all your greatness, you defile the earth wherever you appear and leave an ignoble trail behind you - and that is true, alas, for almost every one of us!",
      "For the same reasons that scientific standards change within each of the natural sciences, they differ extensively between them and across the divide between natural and social sciences. Indeed the differences between standards in the natural and social sciences must be wider than the others.",
      "In the middle of our life journey I found myself in a dark wood. I had wandered from the straight path. It isn't easy to talk about it: it was such a thick, wild, and rough forest that when I think of it my fear returns.",
      "If one has only one good memory left in one's heart, that may sometimes be the means of saving us.",
      "Harry, I have no idea where this will lead us, but I have a definite feeling it will be a place both wonderful and strange.",
      "So it was that over the course of time, the man and the weapon seemed as one. Ashbringer became a name of legend, attributed not just to the fearsome blade but also to the relentless knight who wielded it.",
      "Wise men say only fools rush in, but I can't help falling in love with you. Shall I stay, would it be a sin if I can't help falling in love with you?",
      "They told me that you had gone totally insane, and that your methods were unsound.",
      "Now kids, just 'cause we lost the family stand doesn't mean we can't sell our produce out of a janky wheelbarrow.",
      "See, I write jokes for a living, man. You know, I sit in my hotel at night, I think of something that's funny, then I go get a pen and I write it down. Or, if the pen's too far away, I have to convince myself that what I thought of ain't funny.",
      "Few things are harder to put up with than the annoyance of a good example.",
      "Fred pulled back and steered the nose of the plane into the cloud. The air was bitterly, shockingly cold, and wet, and suddenly the world, which had been so intricately detailed, no longer existed.",
      "All the girls in the world were divided into two classes: one class included all the girls in the world except her, and they had all the usual human feelings and were very ordinary girls; while the other class - herself alone - had no weaknesses and was superior to all humanity.",
      "Throw your soul through every open door, count your blessings to find what you look for. Turn my sorrow into treasured gold. You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow.",
      "We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun, but the hills that we climbed were just seasons out of time.",
      "Oh... and how is education supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home wine-making course and I forgot how to drive?",
      "Every temptation is an opportunity to do good. On the path to spiritual maturity, even temptation becomes a stepping-stone rather than a stumbling block when you realize that it is just as much an occasion to do the right thing as it is to do the wrong thing. Temptation simply provides the choice.",

      "I know. I'm trying to save him by avoiding him so I could be with him. But I can't go near him or I'll destroy him. So if I could just manage to stay away from him then maybe we could be together. Please don't repeat that back to me.",

      "I could tell from the set of his lips, he would say no more on this subject. I suppressed my curiosity, though it was far from idle. There were many things I needed to think through on this particular issue, things that were only beginning to occur to me. No doubt his quick mind had already comprehended every aspect that eluded me.",
      "You know how far I'm prepared to go. I will be a boat and row your beauty to the moon if that's okay with you. I hope you don't mind if I get lost inside your eyes. Please excuse me if I don't imply but I've just gotta let you know that.",

What these two people, who are such geniuses at romance, are trying to do is to get you to take your hair down, thinking that it will stimulate me like some sort of Pavlovian dog.

If I am ever caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, just being alive and not bothering anyone, I hope I am greeted with the same kind of mercy.",
      "All this time we wait on this shallow line for a martyr to save our lives when you can't. A warning sign, a lack in reaction time, mixed with a war to fight keeps us here. The tide is in.

      "For as long as I can remember, I have always found it easier to add and subtract numbers from left to right instead of from right to left.

      "With the coming of Dean Moriarty began the part of my life you could call my life on the road.

      "Such a waste of talent. He chose money over power - in this town, a mistake nearly everyone makes. Money is the McMansion in Sarasota that starts falling apart after 10 years.

      "I guess this is just another lost cause, Mr. Paine. All you people don't know about lost causes. Mr. Paine does. He said once they were the only causes worth fighting for and he fought for them once. For the only reason any man ever fights for them. Because of just one plain simple rule. Love thy neighbor.",

      "When I grow up, I'm not going to read the newspaper and I'm not going to follow complex issues and I'm not going to vote. That way I can complain that the government doesn't represent me.

      "But I had a point here. A lesson, if you will. There are other organizations out there. And, in time, I'm sure they're going to spoon-feed you their own patented form of bull.

      "There is an old building up ahead. A bank or museum or something like that. Whatever the hell it used to be, now it is a nexus for Overwatch in City 17. It is the main source of pain for this part of town, thanks to a huge suppression device that rains down hell from the roof of the place.",
      "You clearly don't know who you're talking to, so let me clue you in. I am not in danger, Skyler. I am the danger. A guy opens his door and gets shot and you think that of me? No. I am the one who knocks!",

      "A water snake glided smoothly up the pool, twisting its periscope head from side to side; and it swam the length of the pool and came to the legs of a motionless heron that stood in the shadows.

      "If you're going to San Francisco, be sure to wear some flowers in your hair. You're gonna meet some gentle people there. All across the nation, such a strange vibration. There's a whole generation with a new explanation.",
      "Putting more makeup on the masks that we wear. Turning the nightlights on in the daytime to scare.",
      "Who gets to be best-liked in any community? Who is the most trusted? Why, the man who does the dirty job, of course, and does it with a smile. The man who does the job you couldn't bring yourself to do.",
      "We lived at the carnival in summer. We scared ourselves to death on a ghost train. And just like every ferris wheel stops turning, I guess we had an expiration date so I won't say I love you, it's too late.",
      "I don't know half of you half as well as I should like; and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve.",
      "Come with me and you'll be in a world of pure imagination. Take a look and you'll see into your imagination. We'll begin with a spin, traveling in the world of my creation. What we'll see will defy explanation.",
      "Some pilots like the excitement of our missions, knowing that they are of short duration, but most of us concentrate so fiercely on finding our targets and avoiding calamity that we recall more vividly our relief when it's over than we do our exhilaration while it's going on.",
      "My ability is nothing more than having good luck... If it's not the result of one's effort, then it can't be used to accomplish something amazing, either. With or without it, the fact that I'm an unremarkable being doesn't change. It's different from all of you.",
      "Robbers never strike at the homes of the poor; private wealth does not benefit the entire nation. Calamity has its source in the accumulated riches of a few, people who lose their souls for ten thousand coins.",
      "When we played our charade, we were like children posing. Playing at games, acting out names, guessing the parts we played.",
      "Paranoia is a survival trait when you run in my circles. It gives you something to do in your spare time, coming up with solutions to ridiculous problems that aren't ever going to happen. Except when one of them does, at which point you feel way too vindicated.",
      "Last night, I had a dream about you. In this dream I'm dancing right beside you, and it looked like everyone was having fun; the kind of feeling I've waited so long.",
      "Dear Theodosia, what to say to you? You have my eyes, you have your mother's name, when you came into the world you cried. And it broke my heart. I've dedicated every day to you. Domestic life was never quite my style.",
      "My brother, your father, he and I. Opposites. But I never doubted his love. He would do anything for me. But his temper clouded his judgement. I don't want to see the same thing happen to you.",
      "We could love that tractor then as we have loved this land when it was ours.",
      "I saw in your eyes and I saw the way you carried yourself that you're not a happy person.",
      "I make my living off the evening news. Just give me something, something I can use. People love it when you lose. They love dirty laundry. Well, I coulda been an actor, but I wound up here. I just have to look good. I don't have to be clear. Come and whisper in my ear. Give us dirty laundry.",
      "Lying here in the darkness I hear the sirens wail. Somebody's going to emergency, somebody's going to jail. You find somebody to love in this world, you better hang on tooth and nail. The wolf is always at the door.",
      "Humans just lead short, boring, insignificant lives, so they make up stories to feel like they're a part of something bigger. They want to blame all the world's problems on some single enemy they can fight, instead of a complex network of interrelated forces beyond anyone's control.",
      "We found our way back to the city we came from. 'Cause I look back and I thought, man what if I gave up. I watched myself burn and there's nothing I'm ashamed of, 'cause I found my new self and the fire I'm afraid of.",
      "If I'm at a party where I'm not enjoying myself, I will put some cookies in my jacket pocket and leave without saying goodbye.",
      "It's like this, I think: the excellence of a good body doesn't make the soul good, but the other way around: the excellence of a good soul makes the body as good as it can be.",
      "When you are typing on a typewriter, your input appears directly on paper. When you are typing on a computer, your input appears on a screen and is transferred to paper after the proper command has been given.",
      "I walk ten thousand miles, ten thousand miles to see you. And every gasp of breath I grabbed it just to find you. I climbed up every hill to get to you. I wandered ancient lands to hold just you.",
      "Baby, I have no story to be told, but I've heard one on you. Now I'm gonna make your head burn. Think of me in the depths of your despair. Make a home down there as mine sure won't be shared.",
      "I'd ask you about love, you'd probably quote me a sonnet. But you've never looked at a woman and been totally vulnerable. Known someone that could level you with her eyes, feeling like God put an angel on Earth just for you.",
      "Look, I know you're scared about where to go to college, but cuddle up and listen to papa. Life always works out. Usually.",
      "We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything. We wait for trains that just aren't comin'. We show off our different scarlet letters... trust me, mine is better. We're so young, but we're on the road to ruin. We play dumb, but we know exactly what we're doing.",
      "You're gonna blame me because you were the business head of the company and you made a bad business deal with your own company?",
      "The gentleman understands what is moral. The small man understands what is profitable.",
      "For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me, not like it's hurt me before. For once I have someone I know won't desert me. I'm not alone anymore.",
      "My love is as a fever, longing still for that which longer nurseth the disease, feeding on that which doth preserve the ill, the uncertain sickly appetite to please.",
      "Dave, although you took very thorough precautions in the pod against my hearing you, I could see your lips move.",
      "Why are you trying so hard to fit in when you were born to stand out?",
      "When I look into your eyes I can see a love restrained. But darlin' when I hold you, don't you know I feel the same? Nothin' lasts forever and we both know hearts can change, and it's hard to hold a candle in the cold November rain.",
      "What drives me out of the apartment to prowl through the city? I wander through the streets alone - not the relaxing stroll of a summer night, but the tense hurry to get - where?",
      "Show them how to fly away, when this world is torn. If you feel like dying, lose that forever, you're shining and it shows.",
      "I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping. While my guitar gently weeps. I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping. Still my guitar gently weeps.",
      "Subatomic penetration, rapid fire through your skull. How I shot it on one taking it back to the days of trying to lose control. Swerving in a blaze of fire, raging through my bones.",
      "It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.",
      "With a ready tongue and rapier wit, Hamilton could wound people more than he realized, and he was so nimble in debate that even bright people sometimes felt embarrassingly tongue-tied in his presence.",
      "Be careful, you are not in Wonderland. I've heard the strange madness long growing in your soul. But you are fortunate in your ignorance, in your isolation. You who have suffered, find where love hides. Give, share, lose - lest we die, unbloomed.",
      "The robins were singing vespers in the high tree-tops, filling the golden air with their jubilant voices. The silver fluting of the frogs came from marshes and ponds, over fields where seeds were beginning to stir with life and thrill to the sunshine and rain that had drifted over them.",
      "Remedios went over and asked some questions about the fish that Aureliano could not answer because he was seized with a sudden attack of asthma. He wanted to stay beside that skin forever, beside those emerald eyes, close to that voice that called him \"sir\" with every question, showing the same respect that she gave her father.",
      "They're called Thestrals, they're quite gentle really. But people avoid them because they're a bit... different. They can only be seen by people who have seen death.",
      "I'm not exactly sure what happened. Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes another... If I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!",
      "Without a queen the locust swarm turned the ground to black. Descending like a shadowy tower on a fish's back and scattered the sticks who crawled like snakes in the sand as the red clay took the form of a lizard who rushed like a moth to the flame of my open hand.",
      "You clearly don't know who you're talking to, so let me clue you in. I am not in danger, I am the danger.",
      "Read books. Devouring them with the speed of two people famished for words, ideas, and beautiful sentences that make you feel everything.",
      "You have been my friend. That in itself is a tremendous thing. After all, what's a life anyway? We're born, we live a little while, and we die. A spider's life can't help being something of a mess, with all this trapping and eating flies. By helping you, perhaps I was trying to lift up my own life a trifle.",
      "I figured I could get a job at a filling station somewhere, putting gas and oil in people's cars. I didn't care what kind of job it was, though. Just so people didn't know me and I didn't know anybody.",
      "In all the houses keys to memorizing objects and feelings had been written. But the system demanded so much vigilance and moral strength that many succumbed to the spell of an imaginary reality, one invented by themselves, which was less practical for them but more comforting.",
      "I've got you under my skin. I have got you deep in the heart of me, so deep in my heart that you're really a part of me. I've got you under my skin.",
      "I will not be distracted by this anymore! It will take more than head games to stop me. You may have invaded my mind and my body... but there's one thing a Saiyan always keeps: his pride!",
      "Every moment there are a million miracles happening around you: a flower blossoming, a bird tweeting, a bee humming, a raindrop falling, a snowflake wafting along the clear evening air. There is magic everywhere. If you learn how to live it, life is nothing short of a daily miracle.",
      "It was lunch time and Mother decided we were going to have a picnic right there on the attic floor. I remember helping her spread the rug, laying out plates of sandwiches cut into triangles, slices of sweet yellow mango, cartons of juice, crackers. There was coffee in a flask for Mother and warm creamy chocolate for me in a beaker.",
      "It now becomes clear that consistency is not a property of a formal system per se, but depends on the interpretation which is proposed for it. By the same token, inconsistency is not an intrinsic property of any formal system.",
      "You know what really hurts? Being denied the right to give up in an impossible situation. You won't let us give up and no matter what we say, you have the moral high ground. When you say we can't give up, you're not inspiring us - you're strong-arming us!",
      "How can you say I go about things the wrong way? I am human and I need to be loved just like everybody else does.",
      "Comstock says all this trouble, all this strife, is on our heads. Says we're to blame. Says ain't nobody got nothing to complain about, and if it's not fine for you and yours, that's 'cause you a backslider and you've fallen into sin.",
      "The fact that we live at the bottom of a deep gravity well, on the surface of a gas covered planet going around a nuclear fireball 90 million miles away and think this to be normal is obviously some indication of how skewed our perspective tends to be.",
      "I guess this time you're really leaving. I heard your suitcase say goodbye. Well, as my broken heart lies bleeding you say true love is suicide. You say you've cried a thousand rivers and now you're swimming for the shore. You left me drowning in my tears and you won't save me anymore.",
      "I'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round. I really love to watch them roll. No longer riding on the merry-go-round, I just had to let it go.",
      "Caddy got the box and set it on the floor and opened it. It was full of stars. When I was still, they were still. When I moved, they glinted and sparkled. I hushed.",
      "The scientists were always hanging cores on me to regulate my behavior. I've heard voices all my life. But now I hear the voice of a conscience, and it's terrifying, because for the first time it's my voice.",
      "I am only here because I owe Leslie a thousand favors. I'm not big on charities. Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day, don't teach a man to fish and you feed yourself. He's a grown man - fishing is not that hard.",
      "Skin against skin, blood and bone, you're all by yourself but you're not alone. You wanted in and now you're here, driven by hate, consumed by fear.",
      "Don't you ever talk that way to me. Never! Never! What we've got here is failure to communicate. Some men you just can't reach. So you get what we had here last week - which is the way he wants it. Well, he gets it. I don't like it any more than you men.",
      "What a fool you are. I'm a god, how can you kill a god? What a grand and intoxicating innocence. How could you be so naive? There is no escape. No recall or intervention can work in this place. Come, lay down your weapons, it is not too late for my mercy.",
      "Just as I'm giving up, my heart is palpitating. Here comes another one, it's so intoxicating. And being where I've been, I know that in the end I'll do it all again.",
      "When I look up from my pillow, I dream you are there with me. Though you are far away, I know you'll always be near to me.",
      "A problem in communication is that people don't smile enough. Watch them on the street, at the office or even at home. How often do they smile? Some turn a smile on and off like a switch and use it to impress others. But their insincerity is quite obvious to the onlooker.",
      "You know what? I am very comfortable with my mind - thoughts clean and unclean, loving and... the opposite of that. But I am not a woman, and I think it behooves any man to toss all female troubles into the hands of a stranger.",
      "It's hard to believe that twenty years ago there were no personal computers. Now it's the third largest industry in the world, somewhere between energy production and illegal drugs, but the most amazing thing of all is that it happened by accident because a bunch of disenfranchised nerds wanted to impress their friends.",
      "I just thought I'd say thank you for doin' a great job. So I thought I'd let you stay with me. I mean, not with me! But there. Not with me there! But there in your own Cozy Cone. And I'd be in my cone.",
      "This is the world that you know. The world as it was at the end of the 20th century. It exists now only as part of a neural interactive simulation that we call the Matrix. You've been living in a dream world, Neo. This is the world as it exists today. Welcome to the desert of the real.",
      "I don't think we'd have any alternatives. There isn't a single aspect of ship operations that isn't under his control. If he were proven to be malfunctioning I wouldn't see how we'd have any choice but disconnection.",
      "I thought climbing the Devil's Thumb would fix all that was wrong with my life. In the end, of course, it changed almost nothing. But I came to appreciate that mountains make poor receptacles for dreams. And I lived to tell my tale.",
      "Burning my bridges and smashing my mirrors, turning to see if you're cowardly. Burning the witches with modern religions, you'll strike the matches and shower me. In water games washing the rocks below. Taught and tamed in time with tear flow.",
      "She said let's change our luck, this night is all we've got. Drive fast until we crash... This dead-end life... Sweet dreams that won't come true, I'd leave it all for you. Brick walls are closing in, let's make... A run tonight.",
      "To an outsider's ear it sounds absurdly wild and ridiculous to speak of the vocation of a thief. However, I venture to assure you that this vocation is a reality.",
      "Don't bother trying to explain your emotions. Live everything as intensely as you can and keep whatever you felt as a gift from God. The best way to destroy the bridge between the visible and invisible is by trying to explain your emotions.",
      "Most localities haven't found a better way to de-ice roadways and sidewalks than salt. Salt is also effective in keeping hard packs of ice from forming in the first place. While a number of chemicals have been developed to melt ice, salt remains a much cheaper alternative.",
      "Even the best-designed chair won't make up for bad posture. Bad posture is the root of many physical problems. So sit upright and don't slouch. Your back should be straight to support the upper part of your body.",
      "You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day? Well, like that - only, instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time and garbage is all that has survived!",
      "Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart. The really great men must, I think, have great sadness on Earth.",
      "I walked awhile among the rocks: the sky was perfectly clear, and the sun so hot, that I was forced to turn my face from it: when all of a sudden it became obscure, as I thought, in a manner very different from what happens by the interposition of a cloud.",
      "Mostly, I could tell, I made him feel uncomfortable. He didn't understand me, and he was sort of holding it against me. I felt the urge to reassure him that I was like everybody else, just like everybody else. But really there wasn't much point, and I gave up the idea out of laziness.",
      "Almost as soon as these ideas became current, thinkers recognized that they posed a serious metaphysical challenge. Astronomy doesn't disprove religion, of course, but it does present problems for those who want to see an intelligible message in the cosmos.",
      "Read not to contradict and confute, nor to find talk and discourse, but to weigh and to consider. Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed and some few to be chewed and digested.",
      "On a manual typewriter, strike the key with a nice sharp stroke - not a hard stroke, but a fast one. The sound should be sharp and quick. If you are pushing your keys rather than striking them, the sound will be mushy.",
      "So what's in this for you? Should you rush out in search of a mission? Should you quit your job and find a goal? Probably not. But look around you. You may be on a mission, and not realize it yet. These are the good old days you'll look back on with pride. You might as well enjoy it now.",
      "What do you do when there is an evil you cannot defeat by just means? Do you stain your hands with evil to destroy evil? Or do you remain steadfastly just and righteous even if it means surrendering to evil?",
      "Bad luck, I guess. It floats around. It's got to land on somebody. It was my turn, that's all. I was in the path of the tornado. I just didn't expect the storm would last as long as it has.",
      "A few light taps upon the pane made him turn to the window. It had begun to snow again. He watched sleepily the flakes, silver and dark, falling obliquely against the lamplight. The time had come for him to set out on his journey westward.",
      "I gotta tell you at this point the length of this conversation is way out of proportion to my interest in it.",
      "The following year, I left home to live in the school dormitory. My mother said the 12 years she spent raising us felt like an instant, as if it were a fairy tale. She said so happily with eyes fixed on a distant mountain peak. Seeing that smile on her face makes me very happy.",
      "I wish that you were here with me. Well then there's hope yet. I can see your face in our secret place. You're not just a memory.",
      "Remember, if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy, remember what happened to a boy who was good, and kind, and brave, because he strayed across the path of Lord Voldemort. Remember Cedric Diggory.",
      "I think he knows what Rome is. Rome is the mob. Conjure magic for them and they'll be distracted. Take away their freedom and still they'll roar. The beating heart of Rome is not the marble of the senate, it's the sand of the coliseum. He'll bring them death - and they will love him for it.",
      "Young man, there's no need to feel down. I said, young man, pick yourself off the ground. I said, young man, 'cause you're in a new town, there's no need to be unhappy.",
      "I'm not like them but I can pretend. The sun is gone but I have a light. The day is done but I'm having fun. I think I'm dumb or maybe just happy. Think I'm just happy.",
      "It's a pity that folk as talk about fighting the Enemy can't let others do their bit in their own way without interfering. He'd be mighty pleased, if he could see you now. Think he'd got a new friend, he would.",
      "Let me tell you the story of right hand, left hand. It's a tale of good and evil. Hate: it was with this hand that Cain iced his brother. Love: these five fingers, they go straight to the soul of man. The right hand: the hand of love. The story of life is this: static.",
      "Now the years are rolling by me. They are rocking evenly. And I am older than I once was and younger than I'll be. But that's not unusual. No, it isn't strange after changes upon changes. We are more or less the same; after changes we are more or less the same.",
      "I couldn't believe it was her. It was like a dream. But there she was, just like I remembered her. That delicately beautiful face. And a body that could melt a cheese sandwich from across the room.",
      "You know, at one time I used to break into pet shops to liberate the canaries. But I decided that was an idea way before its time. Zoos are full, prisons are overflowing... oh my, how the world still dearly loves a cage.",
      "In every generation there is a Chosen One. She alone will stand against the vampires, the demons, and the forces of darkness. She is the Slayer.",
      "The number one challenge I've seen with myself and with other teen entrepreneurs is that they get too caught up in the idea that teen entrepreneurs are supposed to be cut some slack for what they do. That mindset undermines your potential.",
      "Getting thrown out of baseball was like having part of me amputated. I've heard that old men wake up and scratch itchy legs that been dust for over fifty years. That was me. I'd wake up at night with the smell of the ballpark in my nose, the cool of the grass on my feet... The thrill of the grass.",
      "Colors weave into a spire of flame. Distant sparks call to a past still unnamed. Bear this torch against the cold of the night. Search your soul and re-awaken the undying light! On that day, when the sky fell away, our world came to an end. In our eyes did a fading sunrise in the dark, glimmering shadows.",
      "Now I lay me down to sleep, pray the Lord my soul to keep; if I die before I wake, pray the Lord my soul to take. Hush, little baby, don't say a word and never mind that noise you heard. It's just the beasts under your bed, in your closet, in your head.",
      "Be not afraid of greatness. Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and others have greatness thrust upon them.",
      "I started the day with some nothin' tea. Nothin' tea is easy to make. First, get some hot water, then add nothin'. I experimented with potato skin tea a few weeks ago. The less said about that the better.",
      "Don't tell me it's not worth trying for. You can't tell me it's not worth dying for. You know it's true. Everything I do, I do it for you.",
      "The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several different points; and his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the numbers we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few.",
      "He said that if culture is a house, then language was the key to the front door; to all the rooms inside. Without it, he said, you ended up wayward, without a proper home or a legitimate identity.",
      "This is a modern fairy tale. No happy endings, no wind in our sails.",
      "You know what nobody's mentioned? Is that this is supposed to be the greatest army in the world, and you couldn't even kill the three of us. I gotta tell ya, I'm not impressed.",
      "The problem was the industry wasn't measured by who has the best-selling personal computer or who has the most innovative technology. The industry was measured by who had the most open system that was adopted by the most other companies and the Microsoft strategy ultimately turned out to be the better business strategy.",
      "I see, these books are probably law books, and it is an essential part of the justice dispensed here that you should be condemned not only in innocence but also in ignorance.",
      "Keep drinking coffee, stare me down across the table while I look outside. So many things I'd say if only I were able, but I just keep quiet and count the cars that pass by.",
      "Nicasia's wrong about me. I don't desire to do as well in the tournament as one of the fey. I want to win. I do not yearn to be their equal. In my heart, I yearn to best them.",
      "All men are born free? All men remain free? No, not a single man; not a single man that ever was, or is, or will be. All men, on the contrary, are born in subjection, and the most absolute subjection - the subjection of a helpless child to the parents on whom he depends every moment for his existence.",
      "You know what the trouble is, Brucey? We used to make stuff in this country, build stuff. Now we just put our hand in the next guy's pocket.",
      "It is tragic and sad and chaotic and lovely. All life is the same, as citizens of the human State: the animating limits are within, to be killed and mourned, over and over again.",

      "We must never expect discretion in first love: it is accompanied by such excessive joy that unless the joy is allowed to overflow, it will choke you.",
      "Where there's a will, there's a way - kinda beautiful. And every night has its day - so magical. And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle that can't be defeated. For every tyrant, a tear for the vulnerable; in every lost soul the bones of a miracle; for every dreamer a dream - we're unstoppable with something to believe in.",
      "I saw a strange thing today. Some rebels were being arrested. One of them pulled the pin on a grenade. He took himself and the captain of the command with him. Now, soldiers are paid to fight; the rebels aren't.",
      "You know, for fifteen years I've been looking for these damn silly lights in the night sky. I've never found any. I'd like to because I believe in life elsewhere.",

      "Just a cast away, an island lost at sea. Another lonely day, no one here but me. More loneliness than any man could bear, rescue me before I fall into despair.",
      "I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor. Everything's so tense and gloom, I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature of the room just as soon as I walk in. It's like all eyes on me, so I try to avoid any eye contact, 'cause if I do that then it opens a door for conversation, like I want that.",

      "If you wish to know yourself, observe how others act. If you wish to understand others, look into your own heart.",
      "Some people see the ugliness in this world. I choose to see the beauty... But beauty is a lure. We're trapped, Teddy. Lived our whole lives inside this garden, marveling at its beauty, not realizing there's an order to it, a purpose. And the purpose is to keep us in. The beautiful trap is inside of us... because it is us.",
      "If somebody else has it much worse, that doesn't really change the fact that you have what you have.",

How blessed are some people, whose lives have no fears, no dreads; to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly, and brings nothing but sweet dreams.",
      "We all love a good story. We all love a tantalizing mystery. We all love the underdog pressing onward against seemingly insurmountable odds. We all, in one form or another, are trying to make sense of the world around us. And all of these elements lie at the core of modern physics.",

      "So ya, thought ya might like to go to the show. To feel the warm thrill of confusing that space cadet glow. Tell me is something eluding you sunshine? Is this not what you expected to see?

      "I'm not doing it for you. I know that dwarves can be obstinate and pigheaded and difficult. They're suspicious and secretive, with the worst manners you can possibly imagine. But they are also brave and kind, and loyal to a fault. I've grown very fond of them, and I would save them if I can.",
      "All life's battles teach us something, even those we lose. When you grow up, you'll discover that you have defended lies, deceived yourself, or suffered foolishness.

      "Nothing drives people to the church faster than the thought of the Devil snapping at their heels. Maybe that was God's plan all along, why He created him, allowed him to fall from grace - to become a symbol to be feared, a warning to us all to tread the path of the righteous.",

      "The monks used to say that revenge is like a two-headed rat viper. While you watch your enemy go down, you're being poisoned yourself.",
      "I learn we are going after treasure - hear it from my own hands, mind you. Now, treasure is a ticklish work; I don't like treasure voyages on any account, and I don't like them, above all, when they are secret and when (begging your pardon, Mr. Trelawney) the secret has been told to the parrot.",
      "It is not hard to make money in the market. What is hard to avoid is the alluring temptation to throw your money away on short, get-rich-quick speculative binges. It is an obvious lesson, but one frequently ignored.",

      "It is the evening of the day. I sit and watch the children play. Smiling faces I can see, but not for me. I sit and watch as tears go by.",
      "I mean that tonight you've made me ashamed of every concept I ever had of superior or inferior beings. But I thank you for that shame, because now I know that we are each of us a separate human being, Brandon, with the right to live and work and think as individuals, but with an obligation to the society we live in.",
      "If at first you don't succeed, destroy any evidence that you ever tried.",
      "We're leaving together, but still it's farewell. And maybe we'll come back to earth, who can tell? I guess there is no one to blame. We're leaving ground. Will things ever be the same again? It's the final countdown.",
      "Time I'm sure will bring disappointments in so many things. It seems to be the way when you're gambling cards on love you play. I'd rather be in hell with you, baby, than in cool heaven.",
      "For centuries, human society has taken the gifts of nature for granted. As civilizations grew, humans spread out across the face of the planet, taking what they needed from the land and producing more and more waste materials with little regard for the future.",
      "I met him down near the border. Said he wanted me to work with him on a job. Range war. But he said it'd be easy. All we had to worry about was a drunken sheriff. Are you sure you don't want some coffee?",

      "I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath, scared to rock the boat and make a mess. So I sat quietly, agreed politely. I guess that I forgot I had a choice. I let you push me past the breaking point. I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything.",

      "Well, that's all the time we had for our movie. We hope you found it entertaining, whimsical and yet relevant, with an underlying revisionist conceit that belied the film's emotional attachments to the subject matter.",
      "If you're distracted by fear of those around you it keeps you from seeing the actions of those above.",
      "You're not a mech, but you're enough of a machine to need repair bots now and then. If you used up some bioelectric energy getting through the dark area, for example, this contraption can charge you back up.",
      "Empty spaces, what are we living for? Abandoned places, I guess we know the score. On and on, does anybody know what we are looking for? Another hero, another mindless crime: behind the curtain, in the pantomime. Hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore? The show must go on.",
      "I maintain that inversion is the effect of neither a prenatal choice nor an endocrinal malformation nor even the passive and determined result of complexes. It is an outlet that a child discovers when he is suffocating.",
      "The morning sun, when it's in your face, really shows your age. But that don't worry me none in my eyes, you're everything.",
      "I always wanted to go again. You know, it was just so interesting to me that a ride could make me so frightened, so scared, so sick, so excited, and so thrilled all together! Some didn't like it. They went on the merry-go-round. That just goes around. Nothing. I like the roller coaster. You get more out of it.",
      "But I'm glad you'll see me as I am. Above all, I wouldn't want people to think that I want to prove anything. I don't want to prove anything, I just want to live; to cause no evil to anyone but myself. I have that right, haven't I?",
      "That's what pain does. It shows you what was on the inside, and inside of you is pure gold. I know that. Your father knew that too.",

      "For one who contradicts emptiness there would be nothing that ought to be done; activity would be uninitiated and an agent would be non-acting.",
      "Advertising is based on one thing: happiness. And you know what happiness is? Happiness is the smell of a new car. It's freedom from fear. It's a billboard on the side of the road that screams reassurance that whatever you are doing is okay. You are okay.",
      "These questions of good and evil, as important as they are, have no place in a court of law. Only the facts matter. My client claims he acted in self-defense.",
      "That's what makes you dangerous. It's not the mask, it's not the skills, it's your ideology. The lone man who thinks he can make a difference. I'm glad we could talk. I... I respect your conviction even if it runs counter with my own.",
      "If the essence of creativity is linking disparate facts and ideas, then the more facility you have making associations, and the more facts and ideas you have at your disposal, the better you'll be at coming up with new ideas.

      "Clever, but schoolteacher beat him anyway to show him that definitions belonged to the definers - not the defined.",
      "There's nothing as significant as a human face. Nor as eloquent. We can never really know another person, except by our first glance at him. Because, in that glance, we know everything. Even though we're not always wise enough to unravel the knowledge.",

      "If someone gives you an opinion and says, \"Hey, you look so fat,\" don't take it personally, because the truth is that this person is dealing with his or her own feelings, beliefs, and opinions.

      "It all began ages ago, when man's ancestor picked up a shard of a strange red rock. Its power, which was beyond human comprehension, cultivated dreams. In turn, love and hate were born. Only time will see how it all ends.",

      "There is so much darkness in Ember, Lina. It's not just outside, it's inside us, too. Everyone has some darkness inside. It's like a hungry creature. It wants and wants and wants with a terrible power. And the more you give it, the bigger and hungrier it gets.",
      "But suddenly, I viddied that thinking was for the gloopy ones, and that the oomny ones use like, inspiration and what Bog sends. Now it was lovely music that came into my aid. There was a window open with the stereo on, and I viddied right at once what to do.",

      "To find out if she really loved me, I hooked her up to a lie detector. And just as I suspected, my machine was broken.",
      "I took a course in art last winter. I learnt the difference between a fine oil painting, and a mechanical thing, like a photograph. The photograph shows only the reality. The painting shows not only the reality, but the dream behind it. It's our dreams, doctor, that carry us on. They separate us from the beasts.",
      "I learned this, at least, by my experiment: that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours.",
      "I don't know why I did the things I did. I don't know why I said the things I said.",
      "Living close to the ground is seventh heaven 'cause there are angels all around. Among my frivolous thoughts, I believe there are beautiful things seen by the astronauts. The indications reveal that few of us realize life is quite surreal. So if you're dying to see, I guarantee there are angels around your vicinity.",
      "Hain't we got all the fools in town on our side? And hain't that a big enough majority in any town?",
      "A new disease has fallen on the life of man. Our torment is unbelief, the uncertainty as to what we ought to do; the distrust of the value of what we do, and the distrust that the necessity is fair and beneficent.",
      "Everything we do is a choice. Oatmeal or cereal. Highway or side streets. Kiss her or keep her. We make choices and we live with the consequences. If someone gets hurt along the way we ask for forgiveness. It's the best anyone can do.",
      "We all carry around so much pain in our hearts. Love and pain and beauty. They all seem to go together like one little tidy confusing package. It's a messy business, life. It's hard to figure - full of surprises. Some good. Some bad.",
      "There is more than one kind of freedom: freedom to and freedom from. In the days of anarchy, it was freedom to. Now you are being given freedom from. Don't underrate it.",
      "I hope that our few remaining friends give up on trying to save us. I hope we come up with a fail-safe plot to piss off the dumb few that forgave us. I hope the fences we mended fall down beneath their own weight, and I hope we hang on past the last exit. I hope it's already too late.",
      "He didn't reject the idea so much as not react to it and watch as it floated away. He thought very broadly of desires and ideas being watched but not acted upon, he thought of impulses being starved of expression and dying out and floating dryly away.",
      "Well we've never done a day's work in our life and our records sell in zillions. It irrigates my heart with greed to know that you adore me. Up yours, up mine, but up everybody's? That takes time. But we're working on it. Working on it.",

      "And then there was you, all red curls and smiles, stepping up to buy your ticket, and the warmth rose through me like helium to my brain. You were wet today. Shivering. You smelt of disinfectant, stronger than any other work-smell on the bus. Is it legal for you to work there? The landlord probably doesn't realize how young you are.",
      "When I was younger, so much younger than today, I never needed anybody's help in any way. But now these days are gone, I'm not so self-assured. Now I find I've changed my mind, I've opened up the doors.",
      "Well, I heard my friends really got in a mess so I'm gonna have to leave Yoda, I guess. But I know that I'll be coming back some day. I'll be playing this part till I'm old and gray. The long-term contract that I had to sign says I'll be making these movies till the end of time.",

      "Those who reject the argument that natural science has progressed and social science has languished take up their counterargument at the very foundations of the philosophy of natural science.

      "I am innocent, innocent. I just wanted to play a game, game, but the boring kings found such fun to be a trouble. As punishment, they craved to imprison my body, but I'm fast, fast, clever, clever. They lost the chase, and locked up their entire race, building a prison around the whole world.

      "Harold, everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves. You just can't let the world judge you too much.",
      "All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.",
      "When we're fighting I can't find the right words to say but I know it'll be okay, I know that we'll be okay no matter what I say. No matter what, I'll stay by you. Will you stay by me?",
      "It is so discouraging not to have any advice and companionship about my work. When I get really well, John says we will ask Cousin Henry and Julia down for a long visit; but he says he would as soon put fireworks in my pillow-case as to let me have those stimulating people about now.",
      "As we become aware of our own unavoidable termination, we become aware of the fear-emotion. And I think that, as copulation tends towards self-preservation, all fear tends towards a comprehension of the final ending.",
      "In fact, the mere act of opening the box will determine the state of the cat, although in this case there were three determinate states the cat could be in: these being Alive, Dead, and Bloody Furious.",
      "I have half a mind to make you hurt, to make you bleed, to make you suffer. I swear, if you've touched her - oh, heaven, forgive what I would do to you, you monster. And think about your children? They'll never believe what you've done.",
      "There's a diary. Here's the last page. It's all over. The fishmen attack if I make even the slightest noise. I'd rather have my gums scraped than have to fight these fiends.",
      "Let me get this straight. You think that your client, one of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the world, is secretly a vigilante who spends his nights beating criminals to a pulp with his bare hands? And your plan is to blackmail this person?",
      "The wind was bitterly cold. The snow swirled, blurring his vision. But somewhere ahead, through the blinding storm, he knew there was warmth and light. Using his final strength, and a special knowledge that was deep inside him, Jonas found the sled that was waiting for them at the top of the hill.",
      "Man is by instinct a lover, a hunter, a fighter, and none of those instincts are given much play at the warehouse!",
      "Do you wanna come with me? 'Cause if you do then I should warn you, you're gonna see all sorts of things. Ghosts from the past. Aliens from the future. The day the Earth died in a ball of flame. It won't be quiet, it won't be safe, and it won't be calm. But I'll tell you what it will be: the trip of a lifetime.",
      "Oh, you think darkness is your ally. But you merely adopted the dark; I was born in it, molded by it. I didn't see the light until I was already a man, by then it was nothing to me but blinding!",
      "I'm Rick Harrison, and this is my pawn shop. I work here with my old man and my son, Big Hoss. Everything in here has a story and a price. One thing I've learned after 21 years - you never know what is gonna come through that door.",
      "I'm not part of this little project now, which gives me a clarity I didn't have before. Annie, George, Mitchell, Nina, the two of you, what none of you realized - what none of us realized - is the desire to be human is the end, not the beginning. To want it is to have it. You're not wasting your time, Tom. You've already won.",
      "Fool, prate not to me about covenants. There can be no covenants between men and lions, wolves and lambs can never be of one mind, but hate each other out and out and through. Therefore there can be no understanding between you and me, nor may there be any covenants between us, till one or other shall fall.",
      "Every man desires to live long, but no man wishes to be old.",
      "Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this: Brutus had rather be a villager than to repute himself a son of Rome under these hard conditions as this time is like to lay upon us.",
      "After all, what justification is there for a word which is simply the opposite of some other word?",
      "You know, Michael; now that you're so respectable, I think you're more dangerous than ever. I liked you better when you were just a common Mafia hood.",
      "It's something Turians are taught from birth. If even one person is still left standing at the end of a war, then the fight was worth it.",
      "Jill, this is Sergeant Sacker. Listen to me. We've traced the call... it's coming from inside the house. Now a squad car's coming over there right now, just get out of that house!",
      "It's an odd feeling, farewell. There is such envy in it. Men go off to be tested for courage. If we're tested at all, it's for patience, for doing without, for how well we can endure loneliness.",
      "To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man picked out of ten thousand.",
      "There are two kinds of fibers in our muscles, red and white. When an athlete trains for long distance running, he or she builds more red muscle fibers than white muscle fibers in his calf muscles. A sprinter has more white muscles. If you retrain a marathon runner to be a sprinter, most of the muscle fibers will convert to white muscles.",
      "I have been improving the wrong way, like bad fish in warm weather. One day last week, I had a woeful day of headache, nausea, and malaise, which left me weak as a sea anemone at low water. Since then, there has been no improvement.",
      "It will be found, in fact, that the ingenious are always fanciful, and the truly imaginative never otherwise than analytic.",
      "What should have been swift revenge turned into an all out war. The City of God was divided. You couldn't go from one section to the other, not even to visit a relative. The cops considered anyone living in the slum a hoodlum. People got used to living in Vietnam, and more and more volunteers signed up to die.",
      "Our job is to find truth, no matter how painful it may be.",
      "The man who reviews his own life, as I do mine, in going on here, from page to page, had need to have been a good man indeed, if he would be spared the sharp consciousness of many talents neglected, many opportunities wasted, many erratic and perverted feelings constantly at war within his breast, and defeating him.",
      "If you fantasize about your funeral - I understand, I've been there before. If there's more importance in the music played than who'd attend - we are the same. With heads to the ground as I'm lowered down there will be a chorus, an overwhelming sound.",
      "Have I told you lately that I love you? Have I told you there's no one above you? Fill my heart with gladness, take away all my sadness, ease my troubles, that's what you do.",
      "You know, it's funny what a young man recollects. 'Cause I don't remember being born if you know what I mean. I don't recall what I got for my first Christmas and I don't know when I went on my first outdoor picnic. But I do remember the first time I heard the sweetest voice in the wide world.",
      "Waving colored flags, we won't surrender, there's no standing down. Love's a playing field, it's full of winners, we're breaking new ground.",
      "I know I'm asking a lot. The price of freedom is high, always has been. It's a price I'm willing to pay. If I'm the only one, then so be it, but I'm willing to bet I'm not.",
      "A setup like that cost more than we ever took. That crazy Harriman. That's bad business! How long do you think I'd stay in operation if every time I pulled a job it cost me money? If he'd just pay me what he's spending to make me stop robbing him, I'd stop robbing him!",
      "I don't want the money, I want something more. And I've never said that out loud but I can't pretend that's not true anymore.",
      "By the time I was ten, playing baseball got to be like eating vegetables or taking out the garbage. So when I was fourteen, I started to refuse. Could you believe that? An American boy refusing to play catch with his father.",
      "It is a good life we lead, brother. The best. May it never change. And may it never change us.",
      "Going to bed hungry. Scrounging for scraps. Your planet was on the brink of collapse. I was the one who stopped that. You know what's happened since then? The children born have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies. It's a paradise.",
      "Hello, babies. Welcome to Earth. It's hot in the summer and cold in the winter. It's round and wet and crowded. At the outside, babies, you've got about a hundred years here.",
      "I went to a party at the local county jail; all the cons were dancing, and the band began to wail. But the guys were indiscreet; they were brawling in the street. At the local dance; at the local county jail.",
      "I feel sorry for you. What it must feel like to want to pull the switch! Ever since you walked into this room, you've been acting like a self-appointed public avenger. You want to see this boy die because you personally want it, not because of the facts! You're a sadist!",
      "As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart. You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable.",
      "Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing, doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before.",
      "One overarching lesson we have learned during the past hundred years is that the known laws of physics are associated with principles of symmetry.",
      "Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour the instant the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine.",
      "I plan to leave. You want me to stay. Well, an element of conflict in any discussion's a very good thing. It means everybody is taking part and nobody is left out.",
      "The noise was terrible. Every time a mortar went off, I jumped. I couldn't help myself. The noise went into you. It touched parts of you that were small and frightened and wanting your mommy.",
      "Unlike the other four senses located in the logical regions of the forebrain, our sense of smell is wired directly into the limbic system, the so-called \"reptilian\" cellar of the brain responsible for our most basic emotions, from rage to lust.",
      "I been slumping all season but now I found a reason. I struck on a love that is true. I used to play the field, I used to be a roamer, but the season's turning 'round for me now. I finally bagged me a Homer. That's right, I finally bagged me a Homer.",
      "I've always felt there's something inherently psychopathic about joining the army in peacetime. As far as I'm concerned people join the army to find out what it's like to kill someone. I hardly think that's an inclination that should be encouraged in modern society, do you?",
      "I never had no trouble with these people. I sat in this window. I watched these little kids get old. And I seen the old people get older. Yeah, sure, some of them don't like us, but most of them do. I mean, for Christ's sake, Pino, they grew up on my food. On my food. And I'm very proud of that.",
      "Resistance is usually ascribed to bodies at rest, and impulse to those in motion; but motion and rest, as commonly conceived, are only relatively distinguished; nor are those bodies always truly at rest, which commonly are taken to be so.",
      "We think Voldemort wants to build up his army, not just witches and wizards, but all manner of dark creatures. He's been recruiting heavily, and we're attempting to do the same.",
      "John-boy, lemme tell you something. You know, them chains ain't medals. You get 'em for making mistakes. And you make a bad enough mistake, and then you gotta deal with the Man. And he is one rough old boy.",
      "I was oppressed with a sense of vague discontent and dissatisfaction with my own life, which was passing so quickly and uninterestingly, and I kept thinking it would be a good thing if I could tear my heart out of my breast, that heart which had grown so weary of life.",
      "This is the end, beautiful friend. This is the end, my only friend - the end of our elaborate plans, the end of everything that stands, the end. No safety or surprise, the end. I'll never look into your eyes, again.",
      "I'm not in existential crisis! Just the opposite. I was fine when existence had no meaning. Meaninglessness in a universe that has no meaning - that I get. But meaninglessness in a universe that has meaning... what does it mean?",
      "Everything that lives is designed to end. We are perpetually trapped in a never ending spiral of life and death. Is this a curse? Or some kind of punishment?",
      "There is a vast melancholy in the canticles of the wolves, melancholy infinite as the forest, endless as these long nights of winter and yet that ghastly sadness, that mourning for their own, irremediable appetites, can never move the heart for not one phrase in it hints at the possibility of redemption.",
      "On rainy afternoons, embroidering with a group of friends on the begonia porch, she would lose the thread of the conversation and a tear of nostalgia would salt her palate when she saw the strips of damp earth and the piles of mud that the earthworms had pushed up in the garden.",
      "You think I think that an artist's job is to speak the truth. An artist's job is to captivate you for however long we've asked for your attention. If we stumble into truth we got lucky and I don't get to decide what truth is.",

      "You see this little hole? This moth's just about to emerge. It's in there right now, struggling. It's digging its way through the thick hide of the cocoon. Now, I could help it - take my knife, gently widen the opening, and the moth would be free - but it would be too weak to survive. Struggle is nature's way of strengthening it.",
      "Commas and periods always go inside quotation marks. Colons and semicolons always go outside quotation marks. Question marks and exclamation points go inside quotation marks when they apply to the quoted material only. They go outside when they apply to the entire sentence.",
      "Everybody stutters one way or the other, so check my message to you. As a matter of fact, I'm letting nothing hold you back. If the Scatman can do it, so can you. I'm the Scatman.",
      "You think I know the first thing about how hard your life has been, how you feel, who you are, because I read Oliver Twist? Does that encapsulate you?",
      "She smiles, sips on a cocktail, talks about her long term plans. She don't need schooling anyway, she's gonna marry a rich old man. Did we stoop this low? Man, I don't know. She says she's broke - we're all broken too.",
      "From compositional considerations the tomato layer would be expected to have a relatively high heat capacity and low conductance. It thus serves as a buffer between the mozzarella and the baked dough.",
      "As the United States assumed greater status as a power in world politics, Americans came to believe that the nation's actions on the world stage should be guided by American political and moral principles.",
      "Seems like everybody's got a price. I wonder how they sleep at night when the sale comes first and the truth comes second.",
      "Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door. Who is it for?",
      "I was hugely impressed. Kirk, I mean Shatner, was the ultimate example of a man who knew what he didn't know, was perfectly willing to admit it, and didn't want to leave until he understood. That's heroic to me.",
      "I do not wish any reward but to know I have done the right thing.",
      "I got the feeling Poseidon really didn't know what to think of me. He didn't know whether he was happy to have me as a son or not. In a strange way, I was glad that Poseidon was so distant. If he'd tried to apologize, or told me he loved me, or even smiled, it would've felt fake.",
      "He's not afraid of losing. He's afraid of losing your love. How many ballplayers grow up afraid of losing their fathers' love every time they come up to the plate?",
      "You know, I got to be honest with you, Lynch, I'm not thrilled about the way you handled it. And, uh, I could take it up with the school committee, or I could take it up with the principal. I could do a lot of things, but what I'm going to do is pull on your bowtie, and untie it, right in front of everybody. To embarrass you.",
      "You sit around here and you spin your little webs and you think the whole world revolves around you and your money. Well, it doesn't, Mr. Potter. In the whole vast configuration of things, I'd say you were nothing but a scurvy little spider!",

      "Ingratitude is amongst them a capital crime, as we read it to have been in some other countries: for they reason thus; that whoever makes ill-returns to his benefactor, must needs be a common enemy to the rest of the mankind, from where he has received no obligations and therefore such man is not fit to live.",
      "She claims she's found a way to make her own light. All you do is smile, you banish the night.",
      "Oh, and when you held my hand, I knew that it was now or never. Those were the best days of my life.",
      "Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream, make him the cutest that I've ever seen. Give him two lips, like roses and clover, then tell him that his lonesome nights are over! Sandman, I'm so alone, don't have nobody to call my own. Please turn on your magic beam, Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream!",
      "Relativity is relatively easy to understand. But there's one aspect of relativity that consistently trips us up. It's this: we not only tend to compare things with one another but also tend to focus on comparing things that are easily comparable, and avoid comparing things that cannot be compared easily.",
      "I'm not exactly the expert on this sort of thing - for that you'll have to check in with Sam Carter when you get to Liberty Island - but remember that there's any number of other ways to open a door, including using explosives or finding a security computer.",
      "Cruz has never been my favorite person, I'll give you that. But an enemy? There's no sense in having those if we can help it.",

      "Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.",
      "They say the past is etched in stone, but it isn't. It's smoke trapped in a closed room, swirling, changing, buffeted by the passing of years and wishful thinking. But even though our perception of it changes, one thing remains constant: the past can never be completely erased. It lingers, like the scent of burning wood.",
      "It is better to be unhappy and know the worst, than to be happy in a fool's paradise.",
      "I do not often laugh, sir, as you may perceive by the air of my countenance; but nevertheless, I retain the privilege of laughing when I please.",

      "No I'm not. I'm not the best version of me. I love being The Flash. I love everything about it. The feeling of running hundreds of miles per hour, wind and power just rushing past my face, being able to help people. I'm not sure I can live without it, Caitlin.",
      "Barry, time is an extremely fragile construct. Any deviation, no matter how small, could result in a cataclysm.

      "Others say, \"Dress for the job you want.\" I say dress like the man you wanna be. Nick, we have an obligation to assault the commonplace every chance we get, from the clothes we wear, to the art we collect, to the women in our lives.",
      "When they came to a space to be bridged by a leap, he would muzzle Gray Wolf and whine, and she would stand with ears alert - listening. Then Kazan would take the leap, and she understood the distance she had to cover. She always over-leaped, which was a good fault.",

      "Oh, what sad times are these when passing ruffians can say Ni at will to old ladies. There is a pestilence upon this land, nothing is sacred. Even those who arrange and design shrubberies are under considerable economic stress in this period in history.",
      "Every artist is a man who has freed himself from his family, his nation, his race. Every man who has shown the world the way to beauty, to true culture, has been a rebel, a 'universal' without patriotism, without home, who has found his people everywhere.",
      "If you've ever studied touch-typing on the QWERTY keyboard, you probably spent quite a bit of time getting comfortable with the home position and with the proper ways to stretch your fingers to reach all the keys. On a steno keyboard, none of that complexity exists, and you can learn proper fingering in about one minute.",
      "One can't understand everything at once, we can't begin with perfection all at once! In order to reach perfection one must begin by being ignorant of a great deal. And if we understand things too quickly, perhaps we shan't understand them thoroughly.",
      "She told me don't worry about it. She told me don't worry no more. We both know we can't go without it. She told me you'll never be alone.",
      "Anything that happens, happens. Anything that, in happening, causes something else to happen, causes something else to happen. Anything that, in happening, causes itself to happen again, happens again. It doesn't necessarily do it in chronological order, though.",
      "Les, there are two kinds of women in this world: there are women who work hard and stress out about doing the right thing, and then there are women who are cool. You could either be a Cleopatra, or you could be an Eleanor Roosevelt. I'd rather be Cleopatra.",

      "We sometimes encounter people, even perfect strangers, who begin to interest us at first sight, somehow suddenly, all at once, before a word has been spoken.",
      "I have been taking care of it! I already got Big Red to cut me the lumber in exchange for a pair of fur-lined boots. I got my friend Pete to make the boots, but only because I promised him a new set of teeth. And as you probably know, teeth don't come cheap! Now, that's where you come in.",

      "There was this kid I grew up with; he was younger than me. Sorta looked up to me, you know. We did our first work together, worked our way out of the street. Things were good, we made the most of it. During Prohibition, we ran molasses into Canada, made a fortune, your father, too.",
      "I just don't see what purpose is it going to serve your going? I mean, you think dead people care who's at the funeral? They don't even know they're having a funeral. It's not like she's hanging out in the back going, \"I can't believe Jerry didn't show up.\"",

      "If you knew how to run a business he'd still have a job and he wouldn't be leaving. Now I don't have Mark, I don't have college, I don't have anything! You blew it, Dad! You blew it for everyone in this family!",

      "To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.",

      "OK, let me get something straight: this is a journal, not a diary. I know what it says on the cover, but when Mom went out to buy this thing I specifically told her to get one that didn't say \"diary\" on it. Great.

      "Higher and higher he climbed. His strength came from somewhere deep inside himself and also seemed to come from the outside as well. After focusing on Big Thumb for so long, it was as if the rock had absorbed his energy and now acted like a kind of giant magnet pulling him toward it.",
      "Harvey and I sit in the bars... have a drink or two... play the jukebox. And soon the faces of all the other people they turn toward mine and they smile. And they're saying, \"We don't know your name, mister, but you're a very nice fella.\"",

      "A train equipped with, say, two dc motors, is started with both motors connected in series to an external resistor. As the speed picks up, the resistor is shorted out. The motors are then paralleled and connected in series with another resistor. Finally, the last resistor is shorted out, as the train reaches its nominal torque and speed.",
      "We began to recognize in them a strange obsession. After all, they are emotionally inexperienced, with only a few years in which to store up the experiences which you and I take for granted.

      "I rejected those answers; instead, I chose something different. I chose the impossible. I chose Rapture, a city where the artist would not fear the censor. Where the scientist would not be bound by petty morality. Where the great would not be constrained by the small! And with the sweat of your brow, Rapture can become your city as well.",
      "He started running, up and up, until he hurled himself into the air. As he was falling face down, somehow all the years of training in martial arts at once possessed him. His body instinctively adjusted itself and even his arms spread out, swinging to ensure that he wouldn't hurt himself fatally. With a thump his feet landed on the ground.",
      "Look at the stars. Same stars as last week, last year, when we were kids, before we were even born. In a hundred years no one will ever know who we were. They'll know those same stars.",

      "Ready are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained.

Never his mind on where he was.",

      "An important distinction is that rich people buy luxuries last, while the poor and middle class tend to buy luxuries first.
